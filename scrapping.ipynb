We try to call her back many times, and of course, no answer. \\nWe have raised a claim to get refunds on extra luggage, special seats, the flight ticket, second flight ticket (a flight that we missed because of the initial delay), a hotel, and a reserved car.. so far only our claim to the special seating has been acknowledged. \\nNeedles to say, we are never going back on this airline again and will never recommend it to anyone. They are clearly overpriced for the service (or lack there of) that they offer. \\nAbsolutely do not recommend.]',\n",

       "  'Our return flight to Montreal on May 24th was one of the worst experience we’ve ever had, and definitely something we did not expect to experience in Business Class when a family accompanying an elderly and literally agonizing woman was installed in the business cabin just beside our window seats. Since this poor woman was connected to several medical devices, oxygen tank, etc., she needed constant extra care from her family and the crew members during the whole flight, making it impossible for us to rest in any way.\\nAt some point, my wife decided to give up her window seat for the family to be closer to their mother. We were therefore completely separated for the rest of the flight, but it was anyway the good thing to do in the circumstances.\\nLet me be perfectly clear here; we really felt for those people as they were experiencing an extremely stressful situation, \\nHowever, we were also shaken by this experience as we were expecting the worst for this poor woman at any time during the flight. I am also questioning the protocols in such situations.\\nThis experience taught us that Air France cannot guarantee the Business Class experience of privacy comfort and well-being as advertised. Moreover, Air France refused to compensate us in any way. $7,000 for that, NEVER AGAIN!]']}"

is trying to book me on an incredibly early morning flight the same day, which interrupts my plans and the reason I booked the mid-day flight in the first place. I’m trying to get a refund and they will not give me one, even though European law requires it. I don’t like doing business with shady companies, and will never book a flight on Air France again.  EU air passenger rights apply:  If your flight is within the EU and is operated either by an EU or a non-EU airline If your flight departs from the EU to a non-EU country operated by an EU or or a non-EU airline  Cancelled flight  Cancellation occurs when:  -your original flight schedule is abandoned, and you are transferred to another scheduled flight -the departure time of your flight is brought forward by more than 1 hour]', 'The airline is fine until they lose your baggage or something goes wrong. Customer service keeps repeating they cannot give me any information. No one is able to answer my questions or direct me to someone who can. You will either be directed to an automated system or speak with representatives who repeatedly tell you they have no information. I was told my luggage was forgotten in Paris and would be returned to me in Toronto the next day. Instead, I’ve since tracked my suitcase to Morocco with my Air Tag and I have received no updates from AirFrance on the whereabouts of my baggage. Whenever I press for more information, I am given sham numbers to call. What kind of customer service is this?!]', 'Flight was canceled while in the air, supposedly due to a malfunctioning weather radar. The pilot claimed we needed to fly back although we were already half way through. The airline did not make any effort to communicate what was going to happen for 350 passengers claiming that they want to try and fix the problem and if it took too long, they would let us know. When we got back to Dubai we were directed, again, without any communication, into a 5 lane queue… 5 lanes for 350 people to redirect every person on another flight (proving that the airline knew that plan all along but said nothing). We had to wait in line for 5 hours, suffer physical strain, without a hint of communication on the online options, only to be transferred on an Emirates Flight. The agent responsible for transferring our flight had assured us that our luggage would be automatically transferred to the plane. The next day, upon arrival, we are informed that there is no luggage linked to our ticket and our options were: pay an extra 2000 usd to add luggage, or, travel to paris and claim your baggage from there.  We arrive at CDG airport, fill a claim with SBA that assures us that our luggage is still with Airfrance and in Dubai. Next day, we call for a follow-up, the first agent was very helpful, assures us that our luggage is programmed to fly that same day. Come the afternoon, we call again for an update, the extremely rude and unprofessional agent, insists that Emirates has the information even after telling her that her colleague gave us the information that same morning, she kept calling it a confusion even when she was the one to clearly be confused. We asked her how can she expect Emirates to have this info if Airfrance didn’t transfer the file, no voice of reason whatsoever. When I let her know I would like to have her name to raise a complaint, she refuses to give me her name although she has all my husband’s and I’s identifying information. We call Emirates knowing very well they do not have the info, and they do confirm that the file has been opened on another system (Airfrance’s) that they cannot access. We try to call her back many times, and of course, no answer.  We have raised a claim to get refunds on extra luggage, special seats, the flight ticket, second flight ticket (a flight that we missed because of the initial delay), a hotel, and a reserved car.. so far only our claim to the special seating has been acknowledged.  Needles to say, we are never going back on this airline again and will never recommend it to anyone. They are clearly overpriced for the service (or lack there of) that they offer.  Absolutely do not recommend.]', 'Two bags checked in at Leeds.   One bag arrives in Paris.

Since this poor woman was connected to several medical devices, oxygen tank, etc., she needed constant extra care from her family and the crew members during the whole flight, making it impossible for us to rest in any way. At some point, my wife decided to give up her window seat for the family to be closer to their mother. We were therefore completely separated for the rest of the flight, but it was anyway the good thing to do in the circumstances. Let me be perfectly clear here; we really felt for those people as they were experiencing an extremely stressful situation,  However, we were also shaken by this experience as we were expecting the worst for this poor woman at any time during the flight. I am also questioning the protocols in such situations. This experience taught us that Air France cannot guarantee the Business Class experience of privacy comfort and well-being as advertised. Moreover, Air France refused to compensate us in any way. $7,000 for that, NEVER AGAIN!]', 'Going to Bangkok was fine.

The head rest was even in highest poition touching my shoulders. The back rest was for short people and with headrest too low was shaped for back pain.

Over the course of just two trips, they’ve managed to lose my luggage TWICE—one of which they still haven’t refunded me for, even after eight months of chasing them. Their website is a complete joke, constantly lagging and making basic tasks impossible. Changing seats during registration? Forget it. Paying for a seat change only to not get it on the day of the flight? That’s standard practice, apparently. Let’s not even talk about their constant delays, which caused me to miss connecting flights more than once.

Air France is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The company is poorly organized, and the staff is equally terrible. It seems like the executives of this airline have no clue how to run a business.

How is that even possible in this day and age?  What’s worse, when two people are traveling together, they split up the family and then offer upgrades to other passengers to sit together. It’s absurd! So, if you want to make sure you’re sitting next to your travel companion, forget it – you’ll probably end up on opposite sides of the plane.  It’s clear Air France doesn’t know the first thing about customer service. If they can’t manage something as simple as checking in passengers and seating families together, how can we trust them to maintain their airplanes?

Air France notified us of a change for the short leg of the trip, explaining the change in plane, and kept us seated together.

We learned at pre check-in time that this was the case. We proceeded to changing our seats. The only contiguous seats on the Air France site that were available came at the extra cost of over $130. Which, at this last minute, we paid. Our sons, who did not have reserved seats and did their pre check-in around the same time as us, were offered other seats than us on the Air France site, and obtained contiguous seats free of charge.  Air France’s client service absolutely refused to reimburse us, and could not explain why they separated us in the first place, nor why their site did not offer us free contiguous seats, when our sons had their pick.

While they tout Sky Priority perks, we found some if not very few were actually worth it.  Starting at luggage drop off, it was fairly good and easy at CDG.  You get 2 checked bags if you like but we always travel light.  Next was security.  This was a joke.  My daughter who was in regular economy actually went through faster.  So this part was a bust.  There is no access to lounges with the Premium ticket.  Is there an airline that offers this though???  Not sure. Boarding is zone 2 do it's supposed to be a nice boarding experience.  Did not feel that way especially at Pearson.  The gate we were at actually bottlenecks.  At CDG, it was a little better since it was a simple self- scan of the boarding pass.

Air France on their 777 had a 2,4,2 layout with I believe we're 6 rows.  Felt a little crammed.  The seats and legroom we found were better with AC.  You get 2 water bottles at your seat with AF as well as blanket and pillow.  Blanket was actually nice.  Glass of champagne after takeoff with an amenities bag.

Was hoping for better.  Real silverware and a glass for your wine.  Digestif was also available.  Attention to passengers was limited which is why I prefer the AC Premium experience.

When we protested, an Air France agent scolded me, told me not to return to Paris, and threatened to revoke our boarding passes. I had to beg, humiliated, while our toddler held her bladder for over 90 minutes. Every step—from bag drop to security—was marked by inefficiency, rude staff, and a complete lack of empathy.  At passport control, delays and indifference forced us to plead with strangers for help. At the gate, Air France staff berated us, calling us ungrateful despite the flight’s delay caused by their own inefficiencies.

I then sent a copy of my physical boarding card clearly showing a departure time of 12:05. Air France then argued that they would not change their decision of refusing any compensation and that their decision was in line \"with company policies\" without outlining what those policies state. Not even when I requested an explanation why the EU-directive would be applicable, Air France even bothered to detail anything about it. It also deserves to be mentioned that the delay was not owing to any force majeure.  This way of behaving is in my opinion, fraudulent to say the least.

I booked a one-way flight from Paris to Bari on October 19, 2024, through the Air France counter at EWR. I received confirmation and expected everything to go smoothly. However, upon arrival at CDG airport, I was shocked to learn that Air France had canceled my tickets without any notification or valid reason.  To make matters worse, Air France staff at CDG forced me to repurchase new tickets at an exorbitant cost of EUR 1,470.82 for the same route—a significant increase from my original ticket price of $529.60. Despite specifically requesting a one-way ticket, I was erroneously charged for a round-trip fare, further compounding their incompetence.  This fiasco didn’t stop there. Because of Air France’s blatant failure, I had to book an overnight hotel stay, costing me an additional $517.45. When I tried to speak with a manager at CDG to resolve the issue, I was outright denied access to anyone in authority. The customer service was non-existent, dismissive, and unhelpful.  What’s worse is that my credit card company confirmed the ticket cancellation originated from Air France’s system—a failure on their part that they refuse to take responsibility for.  Air France’s actions were deceitful, unprofessional, and inexcusable. They breached their contract, engaged in unauthorized billing, and left me scrambling to deal with the fallout of their incompetence. To date, I have not received any compensation or acknowledgment of their errors.  I strongly urge anyone considering Air France to look elsewhere. This airline clearly has no regard for its customers, and their poor management and predatory practices make them one of the worst airlines I have ever dealt with.

Furthermore, while we understand that flight delays can happen, the gate change was not communicated to us. We relied on the gate number printed on our boarding pass, only to realize at the last moment that the gate had been changed. There was no notification or announcement regarding this change.

After our tickets are purchase, I contacted the customer service and was told the we will be assigned seats next to each other since we are PARENT and CHILD. On APP advance check-in, we were assigned seats 32J and 32K. However, at the counter, I received printed boarding passes showing one seat was moved to row 39, separating us.  This is unacceptable. Air France split a parent and child, despite my daughter being a minor. Yet, despite my efforts at the gate, the seats could not be adjusted, finally leaving us separated by an aisle at row 26. This was extremely frustrating.  I sent this complaint after our trip to Air France complaint website and got a message from Marielle Gracia, a customer care assistant, composing a long paragraph stating that seats are not guaranteed, \"a re-assignment of seat can occur in the case of security or safety requirements,\" \"our staff must provide and engender the essential sense of security, well-being, and overall value that today heralds the varied basis of any service provided by a major international airline.\" This is ridiculous that her reply was not only dismissive but completely missed the point of my complaint. She did not read my complaint and used the generic statements which failed to address the core issue: why was a minor separated from her parent? Is this due to \"re-assigned seat due to safety requirements?\" Due to you are \"providing sense of security, well-being and overall value??\"  I totally understand and would not care about seating while I am flying alone. However, per IATA and FAA guides you are not providing \"sense of security, well-being and overall value\" as you said.

Mister Patrick (I\\'ve had to ask for his name to make sure I mention it on my review, as he deserves ALL the praise possible) asked wether or not we informed the staff about this. We did not.

She said if I needed one I had to bring my own, even though I had called and spent an hour arranging for wheelchair service and checking my own chair. So this time I flew with my chair to the gate. At Helsinki check in the attendant helped make sure everything was arranged for the flight back as well. Helsinki staff was great. When I got to the gate in Paris for the flight back to Helsinki I was denied preboarding because their staff wasn’t there to take my chair down to cargo. I explained I have mobility issues and a heart condition and couldn’t navigate the aisle with other people around. The gate agent told me it didn’t matter. I attempted to board with my group anyway and he took and refused to return my passport to prevent me from boarding. I was desperate to get aboard and knew I wouldn’t be able to if I waited (they continued boarding while I had this conversation so about 50 people were already on the bridge). So I said you can keep my passport until they come but I’m going now and went. A few minutes later he followed me and reluctantly gave me my passport and said I was allowed to board but had to take the batteries out. I just said “I know how to fly with a wheelchair” and continued.

Last week I flew from Texas USA to Paris to Algiers - and then back the same way for the return flight. First before my trip I purchased luggage checked luggage and then after 2 weeks I saw that it wasn't showing on my ticket. So I call customer service and they said yeah we don't see it here. I told them okay. I have the confirmation from PayPal and also I have confirmation on my bank statement that they took out the full payment for the luggage and still they wouldn't fix the issue. Finally 3 days before my flight I had to call again and they finally put it on my ticket that I had paid for it. Then at the airport they give me many additional security screenings and at the Paris airport they weigh your carry-on bags that includes the backpack I had and my small carry-on luggage which has to be under 12 kg. Mine was 14 so I either had to pay $400 to check the bag. The small carry-on luggage bag or throw away all my clothes so I ended up having to throw away all my clothes because I don't have an extra $400 laying around to spare for a small luggage. No other airline or airport has this type of insanity where they weigh your carry-on bags, including your purse or your backpack and your personal item on the plane. Only Air France does this and only the Paris airport. Does this no other airline ways even your personal items and then tries to charge you $400 to check it. Also the Air front staff is always rude except for the staff on the plane like the flight attendants. But the in airport staffs and any airport are always very rude and they don't like to help be helpful or give information. All the Air France flights leak condensation from the top. This happened on all Air France planes to and from my destination. Go look at the reviews for Air France and you will see that everyone that's posted in the past years had a terrible experience with Air France, planes, travel and employees and customer service. I will never fly Air Force again and many people come to me for travel advice because I travel very often and I will always tell people never to fly Air France.]\", 'This review is regarding flight AF185, we booked an Economy Flex flight just so we can choose our own seats in the flight, but even though we’re SkyPriority, we stayed inline for around 2 hours with overly vague information regarding that delay only for them in the end to get back to us and say that our seats were relocated to worse ones.  The halal meal that was given to us was extremely bland, and we weren’t even offered any juice/soft drink to accompany the meal compared to others that didn’t specify they wanted a halal meal.  The staff were also overly rude to both me and my daughter compared to other passengers for some reason (could be because we were wearing a hijab) which was completely unbearable.

My experience was marked by a series of issues that left me feeling frustrated and disrespected.  Sky Priority Service at Hong Kong Airport Despite paying for Sky Priority, the staff at Hong Kong airport made us wait for an unreasonable amount of time without any clear explanation. This was especially frustrating as we had expected expedited service. Last-Minute Seat Change In addition to the delays, my seat was changed at the last minute, and it was given to another passenger. This lack of communication and poor handling of seating arrangements added unnecessary stress to the journey. Discriminatory Treatment on the Plane During the flight, my group and I experienced what felt like discriminatory treatment, simply because we are Muslims. We were made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, which is completely unacceptable. Halal Meal Quality Lastly, the halal meal provided was subpar. It was nowhere near the quality of the meals given to other passengers. The meal was not only poorly prepared but also felt like an afterthought. As a paying customer, I expected the same level of attention and care as others on board. This experience with Air France was incredibly disappointing, and I expect better service from such a reputable airline. I hope this feedback is taken seriously so that other passengers do not have to endure the same treatment. I will certainly be reconsidering my choice of airline for future flights.]', 'I am beyond disappointed with my recent experience with Air France, and I feel compelled to share my frustrations. My family and I booked Economy flex tickets and paid an extra $1400 to choose our seats in advance, only to be given random seating assignments upon boarding. To make matters worse, two of my family members ended up sitting in staff seats, which were not only uncomfortable but also had no screens. How is this acceptable for Premium Economy?  The halal food served was absolutely inedible. It was bland, tasteless, and had no care put into its preparation. To add insult to injury, there was no juice or any beverage accompanying the meal. Meanwhile, other non-Muslim passengers were served well-presented meals. The stark contrast in service was appalling.  But what really broke my heart was the blatant racism my mother and I faced. We were wearing hijabs, and it was clear from the way we were treated that the staff’s behavior toward us was harsh and discriminatory. It was an uncomfortable, upsetting experience, and we were left feeling unwelcome and targeted simply because of our faith.  This entire trip with Air France was a nightmare, and I will never, under any circumstances, choose this airline again. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, especially after such poor service and disrespect. It’s sad to see such a lack of professionalism and humanity in a global airline.  Never again, Air France.]', 'I recently endured one of the worst travel experiences on an Air France flight, and I believe other travelers should be aware of the unacceptable way the airline handled my situation. It wasn’t about “unpleasant smells” or minor discomforts, as the airline’s dismissive response suggested—it was about my assigned seat being taken over by two other passengers, one of whom even laid down in my seat after I was forced to move!  Despite my repeated requests for help, the flight attendant refused to intervene or enforce seating protocol. I had to move to another seat while they completely disregarded my rightful place. This wasn’t just an inconvenience; it felt like a blatant disregard for my experience as a paying customer.  And when I contacted Air France afterward, hoping they’d address this serious lapse? Their response was both dismissive and inaccurate. Instead of acknowledging the real problem—a violation of basic seating rules and lack of crew intervention—they responded as if my concern was about a “passenger with strong perfume.” It was as if they hadn’t even read my complaint! This kind of indifference to a genuine customer issue is unacceptable and disappointing.  I’m left wondering: is this how Air France treats all customers, or was my experience ignored because of my background? Either way, I felt humiliated, unheard, and completely disregarded by an airline that claims to prioritize customer satisfaction.  To any potential Air France passengers: think twice before booking with them if you value your comfort, respect, and peace of mind. This was an unacceptable experience, and I hope by sharing it, others can avoid the same treatment.]', \"Wow!!! What a horrible experience!! I've always flown with Porter and was shocked at how bad Air France is in comparison.  First they have you check in by printing your own boarding pass on a computer, when porter sends you a digital copy. The problem is the computer doesn't even work, so you have to see an attendant (who is busy and irritable).  Then if flying economy, you're squished in a row of 3 to 4 people, the seats are tight and it was the most uncomfortable flight ever.  After eating the tasteless food, my stomach hurt for hours. I was in agonizing pain. When I went to the bathroom one of the flight attendants banged on my door telling me there's turbulence and I need to go back to my seat. So would you rather I throw up all over my seat??   I mentioned multiple times to multiple attendants I wasn't feeling good, no one did anything to help.  I asked for a second chamomile tea the second time they came around. The male flight attendant said only have black tea.

Your job is literally to bring that out and you have the nerve to yell out??   I will Never fly with Air France again. Bad food. Bad service. Extremely uncomfortable.

When we arrived at the check-in counter, we waited over two hours just to receive our boarding passes. Then, only an hour before the flight, they informed us that our pre-selected seats had been changed due to a \"problem.\" They assured us the new seats would have extra legroom, though two out of five seats would lack screens. Since we had no other flight options, we reluctantly accepted.  Once we boarded, we discovered our original seats, which had a “problem,” were sold to other passengers—even though we booked the flight three months ago. The new seats were far from an upgrade. Two of them were actually intended for staff, with no screens, no USB ports, and awkwardly positioned in the middle of the aisle—not ideal for a 13-hour flight. Because of this awkward placement, passengers frequently stepped on my foot whenever they passed by to use the restroom. To make matters worse, a sick passenger sat next to me, and I ended up getting sick as well.  When I raised these issues with a flight attendant, I mentioned that I had paid for Sky Priority to select my seat because this was a long flight and I have sleeping problems. She dismissed my concerns, saying, “You will get refund,” and walked away while I was still speaking. The same attendant later bumped into my knee with her drink cart multiple times and even stepped on my foot without apologizing. The food was also terrible; hardly anyone around me finished half of it.  Overall, it was literally the worst flight experience I’ve ever had, and I wouldn’t recommend Air France.

I understand my ticket had zero baggage allowance, but I shouldn't have to pay twice for the same baggage on an international itinerary.  I contacted Air France multiple times for a refund, but their customer service was unhelpful, insisting I contact China Eastern Airlines for the first leg, even though Air France was the ticketing carrier. This is unacceptable. Air France should take responsibility and resolve issues involving their partner airlines, not pass the burden onto their customers.  I also filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation, but to date, I’ve received no resolution from either party. This experience has left me frustrated and significantly out of pocket.  If you value clear policies and responsive customer service, I strongly recommend avoiding Air France.

Their customer service team are the most unhelpful group of individuals I have ever dealt with.

There is NOBODY accountable at Air France and they intentionally make it impossible to escalate - no senior manager to talk to - no replies to emails or claim tickets - no support at headquarters .  They violate passenger rights outright and use these tactics to avoid their liabilities.  The only thing left is litigation.  Too bad for the otherwise excellent work of their cabin crews and flight crews.  I am especially fond of KLM.

The cleanliness of the aircraft stood out right away, with well-maintained cabins that created a pleasant atmosphere. Each seat was equipped with personal in-flight entertainment screens, offering a variety of movies, TV shows, and music to keep passengers engaged throughout the flight. Additionally, the airline provided complimentary Wi-Fi, though its use was limited to messaging apps like WhatsApp — full web browsing was not available. Air France served a complete meal accompanied by wine, followed by a light snack later in the flight. While the food wasn’t exceptional, it was decent enough for a long-haul journey. Boarding for both flights was handled efficiently and smoothly, with courteous and professional staff. The highlight of my experience, however, was the exceptionally affordable fare. After comparing multiple airlines for this route, I found Air France offered the most competitive price, making it a clear winner in terms of value for money. The layover at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, however, was less enjoyable. The wait between flights felt quite long, and the airport itself is relatively basic for passengers on extended stopovers, with limited comfortable seating options. Adding to the challenge, the airline unexpectedly changed the terminal for my connecting flight. As a result, I had to go through security screening again.

I've flown with them four times, each time on long-haul flights across the Atlantic, and it has always been a fantastic experience. The entertainment options are great, and the flight crew is both professional and friendly. While the food isn't exceptional, I don't expect Michelin-star quality on an airplane, especially in economy class. They have consistently been on time, often arriving ahead of schedule.

Upon arrival at Paris CDG, I approached the Customer Service Desk for assistance: 1. The treatment I witnessed towards other passengers was alarming, particularly an elderly man in distress due to Air France’s staff behaviour.  2. I was informed that no alternative flights to Johannesburg were available, forcing me to accept a 24-hour delay which caused me serious inconvenience and for which Air France has now denied a claim for compensation including for essential toiletries.  Although I received a voucher for accommodation and meals, the support provided was inadequate especially for a Business Class passenger: 1. I requested on 5 occasions (airside customer service on arrival, baggage service, WhatsApp, land side Sky priority, call centre) for access to my checked baggage containing my Chronic medication (I only had enough in my hand luggage to the scheduled arrival time) which was repeatedly and out right dismissed endangering my health and caused me significant distress.  2. In spite of being informed by customer service that I could remain in the provided hotel room until 18:00 (as my rebooked flight was scheduled to depart at 21:20) I and other Air France voucher holders was kicked out of the hotel at 11:00. In trying to resolve this situation I experienced disrespect and a lack of empathy from ground staff, including verbal abuse/bullying from one staff member who accused me of being “ignorant”.  In spite of raising these concerns the customer service team advised in an email to me that the treatment I received  “fully complies with our obligations under the applicable regulations as well as with the commercial policies of our company”  I am appalled at the treatment received and would only fly Air France again as an option of last resort.]', \"I was very nervous to fly Air France after reading the reviews.

Paid 110euros to have my one checked bag sent all the way to my final destination but that was not my worst. I had three flights with Air France before I arrived at home. Took the first to Paris where I had a 15hr layover. Picked up a bug and the Air pressure from flying clogged my ears and never came out. Took the second flight next morning and that made my ear even worse with the air pressure and due to anxiety I became very uneasy, but when u have flight attendants with zero empathy...well instead of deescalating they further added stress to my experience.  My last flight from Panama to Trinidad almost didn't happen because I refused to get on the plane and had to be talked into into it by my companion.

The security staff (Securitas) were very rude and basically threw everything out of the rucksack and preceded to x-ray the equipment.  The security area was getting very congested as staff were turning customers bags inside out.  We think the Securitas staff were jobsworth and maybe the fact that had a uniform with a badge on their sleeve made them rude and obnoxious.

I am writing after receiving an unsatisfactory respond to my claim to formally express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received during my recent flight with Air France. This has been one of the most dehumanizing and uncomfortable experiences I’ve ever had on a flight. The flight code was AF116, on August 1 and my seat number was 9A. As a loyal customer who has flown with your airline multiple times, I was deeply disappointed by the experience I encountered on this occasion in business class.  Firstly, my service ring was ignored multiple times, while the crew was chatting and walking around, which made me feel overlooked and unvalued as a passenger. Additionally, I was not addressed by name or even welcomed, while seeing other passengers around me being greeted, further contributing to an impersonal experience. One particular stewardess handed out welcome drinks to other passengers while calling them sir or madam and when she came to me, she said nothing and frowned at me. The storage area was difficult to open, its corners were peeling, which is unacceptable for a new plane. I also noticed that my dinner arrived significantly late while others around me and in the same row were served first, leaving me feeling insulted and baffled. The most humiliating and ridiculous thing was that, a stewardess attempted to refill an empty plastic water bottle (that was single use and should have been taken away) without my request, causing a spill that stained my seat and the floor, I was horrified. Despite asking twice for dessert, my request was met with inconsistent responses, and I felt that my needs were not taken seriously. I paid €38 for Wi-Fi, expecting reliable service, but the connection was disappointingly slow, making streaming impossible. Additionally, I found all crew members to be passive-aggressive with disgusted looks on their faces, and treated other French passengers significantly warmer. During dinner, my tablecloth was carelessly thrown onto my tray by a condescending crew, an action I found to be disrespectful. Upon leaving the aircraft, no one greeted me, which reinforced a feeling of hostility and discrimination throughout my flight. It was also concerning that none of the staff wore name tags, leaving me unable to identify those who contributed to my unfortunate experience. At the lounge, the staff did not extend a welcoming demeanor, simply pointing to machines rather than offering assistance, which they did for other passengers and when I spoked to them, the response was rude. Overall I was treated differently to other passengers and which I deem to be racial discrimination.  Given this series of unsettling events, I am requesting a formal apology from Air France, along with a half refund for the discomfort I experienced during my flight, which is unacceptable even for economy, let alone business class. I have received a very brief response from the China office which I find very dismissive and am not satisfied with. I trust that you value your customers and will take this complaint seriously. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. (Case number: C-8322415)  I would like to suggest all Asians avoid and boycott this disgraceful airline which is a shell of its former self. I’d rather die than be on another AF flight]', \"Our Air France business class experience from Paris to JFK was truly outstanding. From the seamless shuttle pickup to the attentive concierge service, every interaction was flawless.

Got in contact a couple of times to see if I can upgrade to business and they said wait till you get to the service desk.

Speak to the service desk at Paris and tell me they not deal with people missing their transfers. Terrible service cheers]', 'I received a text in the early hours (about 2:30) to tell me that my flight was cancelled. I immediately tried to respond to the issue.

I then followed another link to find out \"what they are doing to help,\" but it went to a generic page that said they would try to respond to my e-mail (I didn\\'t send them an e-mai) within 24 hours. To date, there\\'s been no response. Without a way to call or find out what they were doing to help their passengers, who were stranded in Tbilisi, I decided to go to the airport to try to speak with someone at the Air France desk (again, this is very early morning now). However, though I found the desk and waited, no Air France staff ever showed up - at all. There was a link on the website (again it\\'s impossible to speak with an actual person) that said if I chose I could request a refund for the full price of the ticket (since Air France cancelled the flight with no explanation). Not knowing what else to do, I pressed the links, and I did get a refund - €17 that I paid for my seat reservation - NOTHING for the ticket itself. Getting no help from Air France at all, I found a flight going out that day on Turkish Airlines to Paris, via Istanbul, and I had to pay nearly twice what I paid for my original, return flight from Paris to Tbilisi. Upon returning, I have written to Air France twice, including my documentation, requesting a refund for my original ticket (which they said was possible), and comensation for the difference I had to pay to get to Paris somehow. Air France have not responded to either message - I mean not even an acknowledgement that they had received it. To this date (nearly a month later) there has been no contact from them whatever - I could still be stuck in Tbilisi for all they care. The lack of customer service, integrity, and simple human courtesy has been appalling to the point of being shocking.

Try another airline if possible!]', \"Our journey from Dubai to Paris took a disastrous turn when we initially planned to fly with KLM, only to find ourselves entangled with their partner, Air France. The treatment we received from their staff was nothing short of appalling, leaving us stranded for three days. While we managed to secure one night in a hotel, our infant had to endure the discomfort of the airport. This was an experience we would never wish upon anyone, especially with no meals or funds available. The lack of basic human decency and courtesy was shocking, and despite our pleas for compensation, we were met with rudeness and hostility. Ultimately, we had to rely on Delta to rebook our flights, as Air France staff refused to assist us. Even now, our attempts to seek reimbursement for our infant's meals have been met with aggression and disdain. This has been our most regrettable experience, a complete waste of money, and we vow never to fly with them again.]\", 'We love the arrival process in CDG - no lines, no waiting for the checked in luggage,no catching a taxi ride. We only wish that the same service can be implemented in IAD.  British Airways and Lufthansa, take a note.]', \"We recently flew Air France between San Francisco to Paris. Our trip from SF to Paris went smoothly. The seats were very comfortable. The meals were fine, and the service was very good. On our way back from Paris to SFO, our flight was on Sep 18.  When we checked in online 24 hours before the flight, we found that our seats has been changed even though we had to pay extra and made our reservations at least six months ago.  My husbands and I were randomly assigned to seats in two different rows. We called Air France right away, the person on the line was helpful and told us that he saw our original seat assignments in the system, but he wasn't sure why the seats on our electronic boarding passes showed differently. He further reassured us everything was fine by sending us a confirmation notice that our seat assignment were the ones that we chose.  On Sep 18, we arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before departure. When we found the counters, there were at least six people ahead of us and there was only one staff at the counter! Can you imagine, one person at the counter serving all economy passengers in Air France's country?? After 15 minutes wait, I ran to a staff who was helping passengers to print bagging tags to see if he could help us as he was free. When he found out that we were in Premium Economy, he said that we should have gone to a different isle which is a long walk away. We decided to wait, finally it was out turn. I explained to her of what happened, she told us she could see our original seat assignments, but she couldn't understand why it has been changed. Our seats were already assigned to other people, she had to give us different seats. With little time left before boarding, we had to take the only option. Our assessment is that someone with authority gave our seats to 'friends and family'. They didn't do anything to compensate, all they said was they didn't understand how that happened. I think they should have given us some kind of vouchers for future travel or free upgrade, but they didn't.   Here is the my rating for Air France: Service on the plane : very good, 5/5 Seats in premium economy: very comfortable, 4.5/5 Food: 3.5/5, quite good, but nothing special. Snacks between meals: They offered sandwiches, cookies, buts, chocolate and ice cream, 5/5. Reservation system: 0.5/5 ! Staffs at Paris CDG airport: 1/5 as they were very understaffed.   I do not recommend flying this airline.]\", 'PROS *  Major international airline servicing my favorite cities *  Fun to fly *  Very helpful telephone and on ground and in air staff *  Pleasant comfortable planes *  Good entertainment *  Decent food *  Good safe smooth and understandable boarding and deplaning procedures  CONS *  Long flight *  IAD is old and inefficient and uninteresting and boring  \"I VISITED THIS PLACE\"... ... because that was my trip schedule- round trip TLV-CDG-IAD-CDG-TLV.

They refuse to do this.]', 'I flew with Air France on July 17 from Boston to Paris, and I hated this mediocre company. From check-in to my return, I had a terrible experience with them. The seats were very uncomfortable and cramped, the flight attendants were rude, the food was horrible and tasteless, the planes were dirty and old, and not to mention that they are not responsible for any damage they cause to your luggage. They broke my luggage and yet they did not want to pay for the damage, claiming that I did not have the receipt for the luggage. But who keeps the receipts for our purchases? Nobody, right? So I am here to warn you that if you do not want to get angry, do not travel with them.

The plane was delayed, we sat on the plane for 1 hour and 15 minutes and the staff didn't explain why the flight is delayed. I have a connecting flight in Paris and by the time we landed the gate already closed. The staff onboard couldn't answer anything about the connecting flight just saying they don't know. They made me stay over night and the way to the layover hotel was really messy and unorganised with the shuttle buses in Paris. When I came back the next morning at the security gate the weighted the carry on which was 11 kg but the combined weight with my handbag was 13 kg and it couldn't be more than 12kg so they made me check-in my carry on.

On boarding we observe that all 2-seat rows are occupied by 1 man/1 woman. I am seated next to a very overweight man.  There is a personal reason why I booked early and reserved our seats which is personal and anxiety related.  Air France stated seats are changed for safety, security or organization yet have no explanation as to why our seats were given to a couple.  These were not exit seats, etc.  I agree with others as to dirty planes and lack of service.  I will never fly Air France and will tell my experience to others.]', 'I flew this year for summer vacation and it was a very bad trip from the beginning to the end. I even got stuck halfway through the journey. Customer service said take care of yourself and we will pay you later. I made a claim in Germany Munich but unfortunately they did not pay anything.

Before that, Coming from Lisbon to Paris, my luggage was damaged , it was brand new , and they also didnt care at the airport. And the worst thing is how dumb they are , because not knowing how to talk in English and working at an airport is completely unprofessional. At least hire professionals that talks the most spoken language in the world. Airfrance is the worst company ever. And being worse than EasyJet (never used them, but heard many bad things about easyjet), is something you (airfrance) shouldn’t want. And on the top of everything , flight was delayed 1 hour.  Never again.]', 'I had a terrible experience on the flight from Marrakech to Paris with Babies sitting in front, next and behind me. I usually travel in planes with kids zones so those without kids can travel in peace. However, the kid behind me constantly kicked my seat, one time I even spilled my drink because of it. I asked to be seated elsewhere but was just told the plane is full and kids are like that. I thought the reply from the flight attentendant was rude as there could have been an easy solution as the father of the kicking child was sitting next to his wife and the passenger next to me with the baby thought it was normal that kids kick, so if the passengers behind me had swaped seats we all could have been happy, but my concerns were completely dismissed.  While I can appreciate that these sorts of experiences are somewhat subjective, the flight to Frankfurt from Paris was even worse as the plane was completely dirty - the ventilation areas had black spots that returned a wet wipe black and next to the seats were week old crumbs and dirt. I asked for help with more wipes but had to wait for the wipes for almost the entire duration of the flight. The flight attendant was also quite unfriendly about the issue saying it was not her job to clean the plane - well as a passenger it certainly is not my job either, it is actually a health hazard for me as I suffer from mold and dust allergies.]', 'I don’t travel much anymore, but use too. I was up early, ( could sleep in Europe) got there 4 hr early flight was running late.

Got to gate and all the staff helped, and then the guy that was there( (tall and look like pilot) took charge, asked coworker to call the plane and see if I could get on, I did not have boarding pass, checked my passport, and  boarding was done for a while. Asked another coworker to bring me to plane. Then as I was putting bag in upper storge I heard friend accent say “ Monsieur hello,  here’s your boarding pass” I made it home and to note the rest of crew was amazing too, friendly, plane was packed solid, thank you ! Thank you, Merci beaucoup!! And great team work.]', \"I recently flew from Zanzibar to Paris in July 2024, and it was by far the worst international flight experience I’ve ever had. I was forced to sit next to a passenger who continuously vomited into a bag and coughed on me throughout the flight. I requested several times to have my seat moved but was told the plane was full. After takeoff, I noticed multiple empty seats, and some passengers were able to stretch out and sleep comfortably. I, however, was still forced to stay in my seat next to the sick passenger.  When I asked the flight attendant again after takeoff about changing my seat, she spoke in French to another attendant and a passenger near the bathroom, completely ignoring me. To make matters worse, the sick passenger's mother got up to dispose of the vomit bags, confirming she was seated next to me. They never came to sanitize the area or move me, leaving me in an unsanitary and uncomfortable situation for the entire 8.5-hour flight.  As an educator traveling internationally for both business and leisure, I didn’t want to cause a scene, especially being a Black traveler in a situation where we often face unfair treatment. It’s disheartening to feel like I had no option but to endure this, knowing how things could escalate unjustly.  After the flight, I emailed Air France, and after weeks of waiting, they responded with an insulting $100 voucher that wasn’t even valid, and they never followed up with a call or proper discussion.  I do not recommend flying with Air France. It’s disappointing to see Delta partnered with them, leaving me with little choice when traveling internationally. The lack of care, customer service, and disregard for basic human decency on this flight was appalling.]\", 'I had the worst travel nightmare imaginable due to the incompetence of Air France. I was delayed for more than 3 days in Boston (on my way to Chicago) without my luggage. Their airline workers guaranteed us that our travel related expenses would be reimbursed.

We filed a Property Irregularity Report and had to list our itinerary.  We were hopeful that we would be reunited with our luggage in two or three days.  Of course that did not happen, nor did Air France try to reach us.  We called them and told them we would be leaving Yerevan and please do not send it to Yerevan. I received a message when I was already in another city that they send it to Yerevan.  It took numerous phone calls by my family in the United States to get them to send it to my home address because I had no faith in Air France at all.  They ruined my once in a lifetime vacation because I had to go shopping for clothing, luggage and essentials instead of sightseeing.]', 'I would not recommend traveling Air France if you are expecting a good customer service. The food constantly runs out and you get whatever they have left, in other words, yes you eat leftovers, and the worst part is that nobody on the crew cares. I was not able to eat at any point in the flight since I am allergic to some vegetables and all that they had left was vegetarian food. A woman in front of me had an issue as well and ñ 3 crew members try to solve her issue and apologized to her only because she spoke French. So, If you speak French it might be a different story, and your issue might get solve.]', 'My partner and I visited Bangkok, departing from Manchester via Amsterdam with KLM. On the outbound journey, we booked premium economy with KLM. The service was so good that we decided it was likely to be similar with Air France, so we opted to upgrade to business class for the return leg.  Regrettably, our assumption that the service would match KLM’s standard couldn’t have been further from the truth. Contrary to what was stated on the Air France website, the 777 we flew on still had the old business class seats. The seats were not clean, and I had to use Dettol to wipe everything down myself. Additionally, the seats appeared worn and in poor condition. I find it extremely unfair that Air France has essentially created a lottery regarding which aircraft have been refitted and which haven’t, while still charging the same fare.  We decided to make the most of the situation and relax with a movie, but even that wasn’t possible. The entertainment system froze repeatedly, making it impossible to watch films or listen to audio.  After lunch, I didn’t see a flight attendant in the business class cabin for several hours. Unlike the KLM flight where constant refreshments were offered in premium economy, no such service was provided by Air France. When we did ask, the older male flight attendant seemed visibly frustrated by the request, which made us feel like a nuisance. Despite pressing the call bell, the flight attendants either didn’t come, walked straight past, or took 20 minutes to respond, only after being flagged down. We spent the entire flight thirsty. I later found the flight attendants sitting around, laughing in the mid-galley with the curtains drawn. Eventually, I was told I could help myself to a banana and an orange from the forward galley and pour my own water. From that point on, it felt like the business class cabin was practically abandoned, with passengers getting up and helping themselves.  When dinner was finally served, it was rushed due to turbulence. The meal was basic, accompanied by warm, flat Coke, and no alcohol was offered. The reason given was that the turbulence didn’t allow enough time to serve drinks, but I don’t buy into that. From my knowledge of aviation, pilots would have been warned about the turbulence through TAF reports and ride reports from other pilots.  In conclusion, it’s a real shame that KLM has partnered with Air France, as I will now avoid booking with either airline in the future. I refuse to pay for business class tickets when the service is better in economy.  Perhaps when Air France completes its cabin refresh and starts caring about its passengers again, I might reconsider. Until then, I’ll stick with Emirates.]', 'I travelled with my daughter for the summer hols, from Jeddah to Washington via CDG. The flight from Jeddah was delayed 4 hours, causing us to miss connecting flight from CDG. We were told that we will be put up in a hotel for the night, and on the flight next morning. On reaching the hotel, they had no information about this. We had wait until late night, till this was resolved. I  was with my young daughter without spare clothes and medication. The next day, I realized that they only confirmed one ticket to Washington.  When we finally got on the flight, we were not given the seats we paid for. Furthermore, when we reached Washington, our baggage was delayed. We were in the same clothes for 2 days. The whole ordeal was a big loss and an absolute disaster. I was told at IAD airport that I would be reimbursed. But Air France has denied reimbursement and are now ignoring my claims and emails. There is no way to speak to anyone.

They were a horror show.  The plane experienced mechanical issues as it was taxiing out to the runway.  Instead of deplaning, Air France kept us on the plane on the tarmac for over 2 hours before deciding that the plane could not be used.  They scheduled a new flight four hours later.  We then deplaned with the promise of a free lunch on Air France and were told that the restaurant food services would be informed and we had to do nothing else.  Not so.  We had to wait in line for a voucher.  Some people found this out only after they had eaten their meals and could not be reimbursed.  We boarded the new flight and sat on the plane for almost 2 hours before being told that they could not take off because they would arrive in Nairobi too late to land.  We were given incorrect instructions as to where to go to find out about rebooking and accommodations.  We and the other exhausted passengers walked about the airport until some kind sole told us where to go.  Air France put us up in a residential building without a restaurant on premises or nearby.  We had to walk nearly a mile in the airport to reach the shuttle to the building.  They gave us a bagged dinner that consisted of a premade sandwich, a juice box and some non-descript pastry.  Welcome to France.  They rebooked us through Dubai (instead of a direct flight) on an African airline two days later, claiming that this was the earliest that we would be able to reach Nairobi.  And, because our flight originated in the US, they refused to pay us any compensation for either of the two cancelled flights.]', \"My journey began on June 28th, a seemingly ordinary day until my baggage vanished into the labyrinth of airline logistics. My flight from Marrakech, Morocco, to New York marked the start of a frustrating ordeal that would test my patience and resilience.  Upon arrival, I discovered my luggage was nowhere to be found. I immediately filed a claim at JFK Terminal 1, obtaining a claim number and a phone number to call. Despite repeated attempts, I was unable to reach anyone by phone. Frustrated, I even took  cabs to the airport multiple times in hopes of getting answers, but there was no trace of my baggage.  Despite repeated attempts to contact Air France and KLM customer service, I received little to no assistance. The initial shock soon turned into a mounting sense of frustration as days turned into weeks with no sign of my belongings.  As time passed, my anxiety grew. My suitcase contained essential items, including toiletries, clothing, and valuable electronics. Without my belongings, I felt stranded and unable to fully enjoy my trip.  After a staggering 56 days of waiting, I finally retrieved my baggage upon my return to Marrakech on August 22nd. However, upon inspection, I was appalled to discover that the suitcase had been significantly damaged. The contents were scattered. I was dismayed to discover that the airline had gone through the contents of my suitcase without my consent. They had merely needed to match the bag tag, a task that could have been easily accomplished without violating my privacy.  The airline's violation of its own policy regarding lost baggage (after 45 days), coupled with their lack of urgency and evasive tactics, have left me feeling frustrated and disrespected. I believe their primary concern was to avoid responsibility rather than resolve my issue. Their handling of delayed baggage claims is unacceptable, and I have no confidence in their ability to provide adequate customer service.]\", 'My sister was very uncomfortable in your flight and the staff wasn’t very nice ! they don’t even serve water to the fellow passengers and the flight was very disturbing! ill never let anyone fly with Air France ever again !

Returning to Abu Dhabi from a vacation in Europe and decided to use Air France as their schedule best suited our plans, NEVER AGAIN.  As this is approximately a 7 hour flight we paid an additional premium for extra leg room seats (16A-16B), however, on boarding we found 16B was both damp and dirty with food waste still evident on and around the seat. This was pointed out to the cabin crew who provided some wet wipes for me to clean the seat myself, stating they would come and look once they had time (which never happened). I sat on the night blanket for the duration of the flight as a barrier to avoid sitting in the damp portion of the seat!!! The whole row area 16A -16C had clearly not been cleaned to any standard (as can be seen by provided photos). When the meal service arrived we found the in built table was also broken (photo provided) on seat 16A and would not support the tray of food or drink, which necessitated a balancing act to eat!! Again this was pointed out to the crew at the time.  The whole aircraft appeared worn and dirty and the two toilets which we used were a test of our smell tolerances, as they had an overpowering smell of urine. We raised an official complaint to AF requesting a refund of only the additional charges that had been levied for these seats due to their condition. This was dismissed by what appeared to be an auto generated response (AI)..!

We had a flight from Seattle to Paris and a connection flight from Paris to Barcelona. When we first got on the flight from Seattle to Paris they had us waiting at the terminal for over an hour, and due to the disorganized traffic and badly managed policies at SeaTac and Air France’s crew, we missed our connection flight from Paris to Barcelona by 5 minutes. Exhausted after running around the whole airport, which we  were told by one of the flight attendants that it was going to be a “short” walk. When we found the Air France service counter, and when we spoke to the people there, they treated us like absolute nothing- not understanding that the customers’ satisfaction needs to go first. I personally can’t believe that these people even HAD! the audacity to treat us this way and how they were showing their true colors was just so upsetting and nerve-racking to see. We also asked to speak to the manager MULTIPLE! times and that so called “manager” never ended up coming. They offered to get us tickets to Barcelona later in the day and unfortunately the cruise ship would have already left by the time we have arrived, and they acted so surprised and showed no remorse to us. We asked if they can find us a flight to the cruise’s first stop in Seville, and they said that we would have to pay €1357 PER PERSON!!! We told them that since it was their fault that we missed our connecting flight and that THEY! were the ones that had to pay for the “damages” and they basically gave us the “middle finger” and sent us on our way. We eventually were able to rebook 2 more flights one from Paris to Barcelona and the other one from Barcelona to Seville, and due to all of this mishap we lost 2 days of our cruise.

Despite my efforts to work with their customer service team to resolve the issue, I was met with resistance and a lack of cooperation in obtaining a refund for the lost items. The airline staff need to have training again, about how to talk with customer. I believe Air France is hiring uneducated people to work in their company.

FYI they weigh total luggage, not just your carry-on.   On way back, FCO-CDG, we were well aware of the weight restrictions so we threw out some things to accommodate a few small trinkets we bought. We took great care to moving things around and using a scale from the hotel to make the 12kg limit only to come to the airport and and be told we need to check our carry on luggage due to a “full flight.” Had I known I would have done many things differently.

Surely they should have vegetarian food as an option for those passengers that wish to self abuse themselves and have meat as default. As a Obligate carnivore I was quite upset by this arrangement.  My second complaint was about a flight attendant who was clumsy when handing me my hot coffee in a small paper cup. He spilled it over my white trousers leaving a horrible stain.

They best solution: Basically they wanted me to pay EUR 700 to make that change, despite vacatingn an extra seat from Rome to Paris they could use to sell (the flight was packed) and despite the fact that I would be purchasing another ticket on Air France from London to Paris.

I have to question the level of staff training that has taken place and the 'extortion' that was going on very publicly putting customers in very difficult positions and making the simple statement, pay or miss your flight.

In Paris airport, Air France notified us that my husband and I are downgraded to economy without our permission or notification and have to sit separately from my mom, which is indeed improper, both legally and ethically. Finally, the best they could do for us was downgrading my mom to economy too in order for us to be able to sit next to each other.

Reason given to us was that our luggage was not on plane (turned out none of our groups' luggage was on plane and we suspect the true reason was the plane was overbooked). All of our group except for us had booked through a travel agent (which allows for a group claim for compensation and possible bad review from the professional travel agency people) and did arrive late at CDG Paris, but the pilot had announced that they were holding the connecting flight open for us. When we requested help at counter, they were helpful to a degree (gave us vouchers for hotel, which said we were denied boarding because we arrived at gate after gate had closed), they informed us that we would be provided with flight the next morning, and an overnight stay (which was the case, we just had to get up at 5:00am to do that after getting to hotel room around 1am). We were given unclear instructions on how/where to catch a bus (outside with bus N1 ) and get to our hotel and were (along with about 75 others from our Air France flight and other Air France flights) looking for bus location when we were confronted by officially dressed airport personnel (scammers as it turned out) outside trying tell us all hotel precinct buses had stopped running for the night and they would provide taxi (for an undisclosed price).   When requesting compensation help from AirHelp they didn't want to pursue it, most likely since it was not a straight forward overbooking. I'll try Air France and my travel insurance next (the other person bumped with me did get some  compensation from her travel insurance).  I suspect the who thing was an organized scam by some Air France middle management and gate personnel to get their palms greased by the beneficiaries of the massive number of people 'missing' there flights, taxi companies involved, hotel establishments involved, to the detriment of Air France financially and reputationally and displaced passengers. I know I will avoid Air France until I hear they have sufficiently dealt with the practice. On top of that when the checked suitcase did arrive in Milan it was still unzipped partially, I suspect by someone that had gone through it to find valuables/pawning items (luckily there were none).

The worst!]', 'I had to make two reservations for my family for our trip to Tokyo because I had to pay with two different cards. I reserved in premium economy and only shortly before the trip did I realize that Air France had made an error on one of the reservations, putting part of my family in economy. I called Air France to try to solve this problem and they turned a deaf ear on my request. The only solution that they proposed for this error in their system was that I pay almost double what I had paid for my premium economy seats  to have my economy seats upgraded so my family could travel together. I spent more than five or six hours on the telephone with various agents of Air France trying to find a solution. I asked to be connected with the superior and all of them refused. I asked for an email that I could contact someone to listen to  my case and no one would provide me one. Except the last lady to whom I spoke,  who gave me an email, to which I wrote. I was surprised that Air France responded by having somebody telephone me. But this person accused me of the error and not Air France and again only proposed that I pay this time almost 3 times the original price for premium economy to have my two other members of the family join me so we could travel together.  Not only was there no effort to find a solution but Air France accused me of the problem. I was scandalized by the by the argumentative tone of the agent who called to tell me, there was nothing he could do. He tried to put all of the blame on me again, which I found counterproductive. I wish he just have never called me because it would’ve saved me time. It was very disappointing to think that the company had no interest in trying to repair what is meant to be a special moment for a family to make a long trip from Paris to Tokyo. The feeling I got was that they did not care in the least. In my opinion, I would say that Air France is OK more or less if there is not a problem. But if there is one they don’t care about it. I recommend that you know this before you travel with them. I won’t be traveling with them in the future, that’s for sure.]', \"I had a very disappointing experience with Air France. My flight from Bangalore to Toronto included a layover in Paris, but a 6-hour delay departing Bangalore caused me to miss my connecting flight. The next available flight wasn't for another 24 hours. The way Air France treated their passengers was extremely poor; the sleeping arrangements provided looked like a mortuary, as shown in the photos. They also only gave €15 for three meals, which is utterly inadequate. I never expected such poor hospitality from the airline. Unfortunately, I would not recommend Air France to anyone in the future.]\", 'Horrendous experience, as Air France did not issue myself and several other passengers with Boarding Passes for our connecting flight to Malta. We were all denied boarding, waiting over 11 hours for the next available flight. The Air France staff at CdG Airport were terrible too, they didn’t even compensate us with any food/drink vouchers, left us with no compensation (as yet) for the flight refusal to board through no fault of our own. All of this, despite me having downloaded the app and pleading with staff to allow me to board. To make it even worse, the flight departed almost half an hour late, in which time the staff could so easily have resolved the situation. I would NEVER recommend anyone to book or fly with Air France. They have done nothing to resolve my claim for compensation to date.]', 'I was flying to Helsinki from Bordeaux. The flight was full and I was not allowed to onboard. I got a voucher from Air France for 200€ because of that but it is impossible to claim those funds because the website does not allow you to add any payment information.

Therefore, we had to buy clothes, sandales, medication, shaving necessities, you name it. Our visit was about visiting Algeria's wilderness and the sahara desert. Therefore, there was no Internet connection. Once we got back to a big city, we complained about the late luggage and Air France denied our claim. I regret all the times my family and I travelled using Air France. Shame on you Air France.]\", \"It's a common issue that AF will lost your bag, and they will not guilty, nor offer help.

We sent 4 luggages from Billund but only received 3 in HCMC. Our newly bought Samsonite suitcase was on her \"virgin trip\" when we received the suitcase it looked like it has been used for years (pictures). We made a complain, lets see what happens.

Also strange that staff working in an International airport doesn\\'t speak English and many AF staff don\\'t speak English fluently. Staff is unfriendly and arrogant.]', 'As Air France’s business class seemed to have received a lot of praise recently on various forum that I read,  I thought it was time to give them a chance to St Maarten on our latest trip to St Barths, especially after a poor experience on BA via Antigua last year. Mrs Fatbear is recovering from a hip operation but can get around with the use of a walking stick, so we didn’t envisage any problems getting through Paris CDG.  Our flight from London to CDG was pretty decent. We landed at the K gates in terminal 2E and our connecting flight to St Maarten was also departing from a K gate. However, it was a long traipse to the security area, where it was chaotic, but I eventually found someone to advise where the Priority Lane was, as this was not visible from the entrance to the security area, maybe due to the masses of people there.  New security machines had been introduced so that only liquids had to be taken out of our bags, all electronic devices could remain where they were. The journey from disembarking our arriving flight to clearing security took 30 minutes, and already the board was showing that our flight to St Maarten was boarding so we didn’t have time to visit the AF business lounge.  The departure lounge resembled a zoo, and we had a long walk to the gate, which required going down a level, and with the escalator broken, we took a lift. Our aircraft was on a remote stand so a bus was needed to get to it. The bus was crammed packed and gave us a tour of most of the airfield before we were deposited at the second furthest plane from terminal 2E.  Climbing the stairs to the aircraft was difficult for Mrs Fatbear, and I had to carry all of our hand luggage.  The A330 has a 2-2-2 configuration in Business Class but didn’t seem to have any more cabin space that the 2-4-2 on BA’s 777s.  The seat had a really annoying over the shoulder seat belt with hardly any length to the buckle and there was a noticeable lack of storage space around the seats. Although it converts to a lie flat bed, the area for your feet is very narrow and goes under the seat in front. The shared armrest between the two aisle seats is also very narrow and not suitable for placing anything on except perhaps an elbow.  A standard amenity kit with the usual offerings was provided, and champagne, orange juice or water were given out prior to take-off.  Like in London, there was a problem with a passenger no-show so yet again, we took-off 50 minutes behind schedule but were still expected to arrive on time.  A very nice-looking menu booklet was handed out and our main meal order was taken shortly after departure. Drinks were served around 30 minutes after take-off with the food starting to arrive just under an hour into the flight.   I didn’t want the starters but was given it anyway, and it wasn’t particularly nice. The main chicken and gnocchi course was OK though, and some French mustard was offered to go with it so at least there was a bit of flavour, as it would have been pretty bland without this.  Midway through the flight one of the cabin crew asked if we would put down both of our window blinds as some passengers wanedt to get some sleep. Seeing this was a day flight, I am puzzled why airlines insist on this, especially as the amenity kit includes eye shades for those who want to sleep. I’m not sure why they bother to include them.   As I wanted to read we kept one of the blinds open rather than put a light on. When I went to the toilet soon after, I noticed about two thirds of the cabin were awake watching the inflight entertainment rather than sleeping.   The toilet, situated between rows 4 and 5 was the largest I have ever come across on an aircraft. Even the very large people in the US show 600 Pounders would not have any problems using the facility !   WiFi was available but it wasn’t free, costing €10 for one hour or €22 for the whole flight. I didn’t bother with it.  Just over an hour before landing more food was served. The main item was a brioche cut in half with a filler which was mostly goat’s cheese. Again, it wasn’t great. I didn’t eat the grapefruit salad, but Mrs Fatbear said it was the only nice thing she had eaten on both our flights. There was also a finger shaped piece of sponge cake which was pretty tasteless.  Our arrival at St Maarten was on time despite the late departure. Juliana Airport was ravaged by hurricane Irma in 2017 and still hasn’t been fully renovated. However, the four parking fingers to the terminal are again operational and three aircraft were already attached to the terminal as we taxied. Unfortunately, the A330 parked at the gate but wasn’t connected to the terminal. Instead, we had to go down some steps before boarding another packed bus, which took what seemed to be 10 minutes to travel the 400 metres to the arrivals area.  Finding some positives, the AF flight attendants were very friendly but surprisingly the food was terrible. Next time we will go back to BA via Antigua.]', \"During the on-line check-in I had to scan our passports to be uploaded to our reservation. It worked first time for Mrs Fatbear’s passport but took five attempts for mine before it was successful. This turned out to be a waste of time as we had to show our passports at the gate anyway.  The boarding pass recommended arriving at T4 at 03.45 for a 06.15 departure. Nothing was open when we arrived at T4 at 04.15 except some check-in desks. Security did not open until 04.30 but not the fast-track, so this was one privilege of business class not available.   The last time I flew Air France from T4, admittedly pre-Covid, Sky Team had a lounge but this has now been taken over by Etihad. None of the information screens in the departure lounge made reference to Air France/KLM having access at any of the lounges in T4, although I have subsequently learnt that the Plaza Premium Lounge is available for AF business passengers, although it is completely at the opposite end of the terminal from where AF flights depart !  Boarding started on time at 05.45 but once on board it was announced that one passenger had been denied boarding, and their five bags needed to be off-loaded. Mrs Fatbear watched the comedy events outside from her window seat, as it took 50 minutes to locate the bags before we could proceed with the departure. I thought airlines now had baggage processes automated so they knew where everyone’s luggage was located in the hold, but apparently this must not be the case.  Our aircraft was an Airbus 220 and had a 2-3 configuration, with the middle seat of the three blocked in business class. The leg-room was reasonable and better than I remember in BA's Club Europe.  We eventually took-off over 50 minutes late but with the flight only taking 35 minutes we were on the stand at CDG only 20 minutes behind schedule.  The breakfast served was nicely presented but the pancake with a cheese filling with sliced gherkins and carrots, but it tasted very bland although it was edible. The croissant was fresh, but I didn’t try the pineapple salad. Champagne was available but it was too early in the morning, even for Mrs Fatbear, so we had just an orange juice ! On such a short flight, we were served just 10 minutes after take-off.]\", \"Besides departing behind schedule on my first flight to Paris.

Then there was a delay of 25 mins to boarding. On board an announcement was made at 9:45 that flight time to Paris would be 1 hr 30 mins but we were still sitting on the runway in Dublin at 10:35 am and then in Paris a short delay for the aircraft to park. We spoke with an AF lady at the  gate and a flight attendant about our connection at 1:20 pm Paris time. We rushed through security to the gate on arrival but missed our flight. We were told at the service desk (after queuing for an hour in very hot conditions) we could travel that evening 9 pm via Incheon with Korean Air. Not only unacceptable but I felt unwell with a heart rate of 135 bpm on my smart watch (I have a pacemaker) and made it clear that it was impossible for me to travel that evening. We were directed to customer services again no empathy or concern, then to a luggage area where some 5 hours later our luggage was returned to us and we were left abandoned at CDG airport ( 70 &amp; 75 yrs old) with absolutely no concern at all for my medical issue or mental health state.

The site crashed multiple times and told me my booking was confirmed when I never finished booking it. I book flights frequently and have never seen anything like it. The customer service team were rude and unhelpful. All I wanted to understand was why the prices differed so greatly.

This was a long flight, which included two meals.  Main meal (turkey dish) was good. This being a French company, the 2nd meal was mostly different small packages of bread &amp; yogurt.  They served only beer and wine, so rum and coke was not an option. Delta put us on this flight after a missed connection due to air traffic and we were surprised to find that Air France has a very strict 12 KG (26.4 lb) total carry-on weight limit per passenger (Delta does not).  My small suitcase and computer bag totaled slightly over 28 lbs. so the suitcase had to be checked for an additional cost. Same with my wife and this cost about $130 extra that Delta wouldn't cover.]\", 'They took my carryon from the flight and promise to give me at arrival and disappeared. Finally back home without and  then told me to pay $250 to send it. I never ever use and recommended Air France to anyone. Terrible service, food and you may be robbed like me at the end.]', 'The worst airlines! Avoid it! 0 customer service, all staff of airfrance having a bad attitude and rude. We traveled from Paris to Abu Dhabi, it was the worst flight. We arrived on time to CDG airport (very bad too ) and found out that our tickets for flight were canceled due the reason we didn\\'t use the train, while we arrived by car. However in the airport Air France staff was chantaging us saying \"You wanna fly you must pay the fine\"! And we have no choice because they were not trying to help us or understand the situation. We paid 500 Euro each, we didn\\'t get any receipts for those payments. After they were doing everything do no let us to catch the flight! Worst worst airlines! Dont travel with them! 0 is a compliment for their unprofessional and careless work! We ended up paying almost 2000 euro for this bad airline! SHAME!!]', 'My husband and I had planned our holiday to Mauritius for some time.   Boarding was slightly late but efficient and we were soon offered all the amenities.  We had the middle seats together.  The staff were attentive and effective.  Food was delicious and we soon settled in for the overnight flight.  Breakfast was also excellent.  Our luggage was offloaded and collected quickly and we were soon on our way to teh hotel.]', 'Terrible.  Last minute cancellation and no information on changes.  Terrible.  The second time I have had this problem with \"Flying Blue\" Airlines.]', 'Worst company, if you have the opportunity to choose another one, do it. all the flights on which I flew were shifted in time. The company announced this at the last minute, although it knew earlier that the flight would be rescheduled. There are big problems with connections; the journey took 24 hours instead of 6 hours. There is no compensation, they say read the contract.]', \"My wife and I flew on AF158 from Paris to Dallas on Wednesday, June 26th. We checked in three pieces of luggage. Air France made a business decision to pull 187 pieces of customer luggage (10,000 lbs) from the flight to accommodate a large air freight shipment to Dallas. We received one bag in Dallas and waited with 80 other customers for 50 minutes without any Air France announcement that bags were pulled off the plane in Paris. We waited another 30 minutes to get a phone number to claim our bags.  We called the Air France number and made a claim. The agent said one of our two bags was going to Dallas on the next flight, but unfortunately, one bag was mislabeled to DEL instead of DFW. It seemed easy to fix: locate the bag in Paris and change the tag to DFW. The agent agreed and said they would contact Paris. Nothing happened. I made three more calls pleading with agents to contact Paris before our bag was scheduled to go to India. Again, nothing. Now, our bag is on the way to India, but the airline cannot confirm if our bag made it to India.  After five phone calls, I also drove to DFW yesterday to talk to the Air France check-in staff, and no one can tell me where my bag is located. Adding to our bad luck, the lost bag was full of gifts we had purchased on our trip for our new grandchildren, birthday gifts, and Christmas gifts.  Over the past 39 years, I have had the opportunity to travel 2.5 million miles on airlines for business and personal travel. This was my first trip and most likely my last on Air France. A company that makes a business decision to choose shipping air freight over customer luggage, pulling 187 pieces off a plane, is out of touch with customers' needs and the time required to navigate their system to locate delayed luggage.]\", 'Worst customer service! Makes you jump through hoops and every time you call back you get a different answer! What a nightmare!]', 'Terrible airline. Your luggage never arrives with you on the same flight. Customer service will not give you accurate information about the status of your luggage. Do not fly this airline with checked in luggage.]', \"I have flown business class on British Airways, Lufthansa, United, and American the last couple of years and I was excited to try Air France's new non-stop between Paris and Phoenix.    On the way over, it was OK.  Air France's business class (at least on the 777 and 787) is definitely a step down from the others.  The food and cabin service is above average, but the seat is poorly laid out and furnished.  The seat controls are on a ledge where my arm rested, which caused unexpected seat movement.  The foot room is cramped.  Using the coat hook blocks part of the video screen. In-flight entertainment is generally poorer on foreign airlines, but Air France offers less selection than BA or Lufthansa.  On the way back my seat malfunctioned and would not recline fully.  I consider this a major problem as lie-flat seats are my primary attraction to business class.  The cabin crew worked on the seat for 20 minutes but ended up shrugging their shoulders.  They said the seat was safe, but it kept sliding back and forth.  As compensation, they offered me flight miles or a $200 voucher.  Since the difference between business and premium economy is well over $1,000, I thought a crappy voucher was ridiculous.  The whole experience doesn't bode well for the success of their expanded non-stop service.  Next time I'll fly a more customer-friendly airline.]\", 'I posted today about my nightmare from Miami to Paris.  It didn\\'t end there.  2 hours after my flight to Paris was supposed to arrive, I was supposed to be on an Air France flight to Lyon.  I\\'d booked 2 tix, 1 for me and one for my aunt.  My aunt couldn\\'t make it so days before I called and told them my aunt can\\'t make it.  The agent said \"so you are cancelling these reservations?\"  I said \"no\", she said, \"ok I\\'m going to cancel the reservations, I said \"no\", that went on for awhile until I thought she got it.  Well, after the whole landing in Paris, late, with no luggage debacle, guess what?  She\\'d cancelled my flight.  I can not express enough how unhelpful and rude the Air France employees were.  I couldn\\'t print a boarding pass or any proof of the flight from the kiosk because - well, my flight had been cancelled, all I had was the confirmation number.  The employees who guard the lines wouldn\\'t let me through - and I speak French BTW.  I got the run around, back and forth.  There was 1 woman in the Business Class area who tried to help but she too was powerless and sent me running.  I was sweating profusely by the time I found the correct \"Ticketing\" office.  By then I\\'d missed my flight.  The agent acknowledged it was their fault.  I asked for an upgrade due to their mistake, that woman looked at me like I had grown horns.  So they get to make mistakes but we suffer.  I really don\\'t understand how the airlines get away with this.  Air travel has become such a nightmare.  The prices rise but the service nose dives.  It\\'s time for some kind of revolt.]', \"We flew economy on Air France from Vancouver to the Cote d'Azur, France.  Everything was great.  Check in was very efficient. The seats were comfortable and service was great.  Food on board was excellent.  On our return trip, there was another airlines plane that was late but booked through Air France so we were going to miss our connection.  Air France employees at the Nice airport took care of everything.  Arranged and paid for our hotel, lunch and dinner and refunded us the fee I paid for the seats on the flight.  Extremely helpful, friendly and considerate and got us on the next available flight to Vancouver. Well done, excellent staff all round.]\", \"I've had a terrible experience with Air France's customer service. Over the past week, I've contacted 8-10 representatives via phone and chat, trying to book a flight with my pet. None of them seemed knowledgeable or experienced, and I received different answers each time.  Since I couldn't book seats online due to traveling with a pet, I had to do it over the phone. Despite providing my booking reference number, each representative started from scratch, causing unnecessary delays. It's been a week, and my seats are still not properly booked, with each new booking attempt taking 24-48 hours for confirmation.  The lack of coordination, consistency, and knowledgeable staff is extremely frustrating and unprofessional. I hope Air France addresses these issues and improves their customer service.]\", 'I should’ve taken French Bee and saved $800, but I wanted some sort of “comfort” of a “classier” airline. My seat was broken and would swing up and down which wasn’t pleasant for the person behind me. The food, TERRIBLE. I can’t believe they are okay serving such trash food. It must all end up in the garbage. What a waste. I was offered an upgrade at a cost but both flights I was unable to check in online due to technical errors and missed the opportunity to upgrade. If only I could not be starving after a flight!]', 'The flights from Montreal to Paris and Paris to Tunis were terrible. Extremely poor service and disrespectful employees on Air France made my travel experience highly unpleasant. Certain staff members, including the purser on the second flight, on two consecutive flights were unprofessional and discourteous, significantly detracting from my comfort and peace of mind. I strongly recommend avoiding Air France to ensure a more respectful and satisfactory flight experience.]', 'Avoid Air France at all costs. They lost my suitcase, and they do not have help desk agents. Their customer service phone line results in an infinite hold loop. When trying to book, look anywhere else!!]', 'I have never taken a flight where we were delayed for 4 HOURS ON THE RUNWAY.  Why you may ask? Umm, depends on which of the flight crew you ask during those 4 hours because we got differing answers each time.  And with so many crew members working, you would have thought that instead of the captain giving updates in French for about 5 minutes each time (as opposed to a 30 second to one minute translation in incomprehensible English) there could have been at least one person who could speak English so that we could understand wtf was going on!  To add insult to injury I called the \"customer service\" line to ask if they knew what was going on to which I got a typical AF response from \"Stefan\" who answered me with \"what do you want me to do, fly the plane for you\"?  That pretty much sums up Air France, the worst airline one can fly.]', \"Really, has changed a lot. The legroom is like I'm flying with Ryanair, there is not space, I couldn't relax. For 3,5 hours travel they gave us one piece of cake and two biscuits. My next flight that it was again around 3,5 hours from Paris to Marrakesh they gave us for lunch a toast with a slice of cucumber inside. We couldn't buy another food during the flight, but at least the staff was polite and they offered us another extra toast. In general my conclusion is, that is not comfortable.]\", 'I offer business class for my parent . It is shameful it is the same as economy but only 3 seat .

On May 23, I received an email and a text message informing me that Air France cannot accommodate me, and my reservation was changed to May 27 for no reason. I have been using AF for many years. This kind of service is terrible, especially when I can use other airlines. The food was also not so good. I will think twice before considering Air France in the future.]', 'My flight was delayed for more than 6 hours at the Paris airport. A couple days later I contacted the Air France customer service to claim financial compensation for the delay, which the company is legally meant to provide according to European flight customer regulations.  Almost 4 months later I haven\\'t received any compensation, and the company stopped following up with me. I called customer service many times and I was always told they would get back in touch with me on the phone and via email, but they never did. I was the one having to do all the follow-up with no positive outcome.  It seems to me that the company is trying to \"save\" money on those delay compensations.]', \"Our recent flight with Air France was the worst experience we've had in over 30 years of travel with various airlines. We selected Air France specifically for a layover in CDG—where we had prior arrangements—on our return journey from Istanbul to Los Angeles. However, less than 12 hours before departure, Air France abruptly cancelled our flight without offering any explanation. Despite our attempts to get clarity from their customer service over the phone, we were directed to go to the airport—an hour away—to find out more details. This unexpected situation left us scrambling to make new travel arrangements in Istanbul and completely disrupted our plans back home in the US.  About half an hour later, Air France informed us via email that our flight had been rebooked with LOT Airlines via Warsaw, Poland, resulting in an arrival time 4 hours later than our original schedule. Additionally, our flight from Warsaw to Los Angeles experienced an additional 3-hour delay, bringing the total delay to 7 hours.  When we sought compensation under EU 261 regulations, Air France shockingly denied responsibility, claiming our flights were outside the EU. This was perplexing because our original itinerary involved travel to and from CDG, France (within the EU), and we were rerouted through Warsaw, Poland (also within the EU), where we endured a 10-hour layover with significant delays. This ordeal resulted in our arrival time in the US being pushed from 4:05 PM to 11:05 PM, causing immense emotional stress and financial losses due to last-minute constant changes, disruption to work and plans, and navigating foreign countries with limited resources.  We strongly advise against choosing Air France if you value peace of mind. Their actions appeared profit-driven, potentially cancelling our flight due to low passenger numbers and transferring us to LOT Airlines without providing compensation or taking responsibility, based on our profiles. We are crossing Air France off our list forever, and will choose more reliable and ethical airlines for future travel.]\", 'Worst airline I’ve ever used. Air hostess was rude on one of the flights. One my return, Air France lost my luggage that had expensive personal items, rental gear and necessities including medicine. Air France has poor customer service and has not given me any updates. The seats are way smaller &amp; uncomfortable than typical international airlines, the food &amp; service sucks. It is not clean and some of their air hostesses are unprofessional &amp; rude. It’s been over a week now and I have still not received my luggage. I am very upset. I travel very often and this has never happened to me with other airlines.   Something to note, when I booked I booked via KLM and it’s website, it was certainly false advertising since it said KLM (which I have no problem with) but as soon as I paid, my tickets came as Air France. I dislike false and pretense advertising disguised as something else. If you merge, let people decipher on their own by the rotten reviews Air France has. This was the worst travel experience I’ve ever had. I have lost my best items and luggage, I’ve missed necessary deadlines and items. I would not recommend Air France to my worst enemy.   I have global entry so I zoomed through customs &amp; was the first to get to buggage claim. But I waited until the end &amp; nothing!!  They sent me auto message saying “delayed buggage” &amp; they actually LOST the buggage &amp; I haven’t heard anything now for over a week]', 'If I could give this business minus 10 stars, I would. Never but never in all my decades of travel have I had a worse experience, and never but never would I ever fly this airline again, even if it meant I had to travel by train across the US and then boat to Europe. ANYTHING would be preferable that experiencing what I experienced with them.  I was moving to Europe with my 3 precious cats, and had purchased tickets for them to fly with me in the cabin. 4 friends accompanied us to help with the move. My travel agent booked us a flight that had a connection in Paris, and when I saw the amount of time at the airport in Paris was only one hour, I was concerned. I checked with my agent and also I phoned Air France several times, to confirm that one hour would be sufficient, and they all assured me that that it would be.  The flight itself was extremely stressful. I had brought with me a portable litter box, so that I could take my 3 cats one by one to the bathroom so they could relieve themselves and not have to go in their carriers. However, when I got up to take the first one (in its carrier) to the bathroom, a flight attendant stopped me and insisted they had to all stay under the seats in their carriers the entire duration of the flight. This was absurd. They were safely in their carriers, and me letting them out in the bathrooms would have caused no harm to anyone!!!! Instead, I was forced to suffer right along with them for the duration of that long flight. It was awful! And of course by the time we arrived, the carriers had been filled with pee and poop, and the smell was way worse than what would have happened had I been allowed to take them to the bathroom. A far worse situation for all of us and for the people around us!!!  Once we went through security and arrived at the gate for our connecting flight in Paris, we were so relieved to see that the plane was still there. But then, shockingly, the woman at the gate told me they had \"just this moment closed it.\" However, one of our party was a flight attendant, and she knew the rules as to when the plane doors could be closed, and we were still within the time frame by a few minutes. However, the attendant at the gate apologized and said she had been specifically instructed not to let anyone on the plane who was from the LAX flight, which was totally insane. We begged and pleaded, as we stood there, a party of 5 people with 3 cats who had already endured the long flight from LA and the stress of having to go through security although we were only transitioning. That plane stood there too, at least another 10 minutes, with our empty seats. The entire situation was insane: the airline had very deliberately slammed the door in our faces.  When, in tears, with my 3 poor cats, we went to the desk to inquire about next flights, we were told the next direct flight to Split was 4 days away. That made the refusal to admit us to this flight all the more insane, of course. We then were forced to change terminals yet again, go through security yet again (also more suffering for my cats, who are 14 years old and had already gone through security twice, once in LA and once in Paris). Once we arrived at the desk for Croatia Airlines, I was forced to pay again for my cats and for the extra luggage, although that had all been paid in LA already. We then had to suffer through the subsequent 2 flights, before finally arriving in Split at 11 pm, 20 hours after we had left LA. We had originally chartered a water taxi to take us to the island of Hvar, our ultimate destination, but of course by midnight, it had long been canceled.  Not only all that, but when we arrived, 2 pieces of our luggage did not arrive with us. By the time we finished filling out the forms to report the missing luggage, it was midnight and they locked the airport doors behind us as we left, the last ones to leave the airport. We then had to find a pet-friendly hotel nearby and take taxis to that hotel, incurring additional expenses we never would have had, had we been allowed on that plane in Paris which sat there on the tarmac for 10 minutes as we begged and cried to be let on.  When I reported this horrible situation to Air France and demanded reimbursement for the over $1000 I had been forced to pay (again!!) for my cats and luggage, plus for the hotel we were forced to stay at, I received this response:  \"Thank you for your email dated 3 May 2024 regarding your recent experience while travelling with us.  I appreciate that you shared your disappointment with us. Our records shows that the flight change was caused by a booking error on your original flight. As a result, we kindly ask you to contact your travel agency to request for possible reimbursement of your incurred expenses.  I trust I have informed you sufficiently.

When we dropped the bags and proceeded to Security Check they randomly weighted my carryon and told me that I was 2 Kilos overweight and needed to check it in. It cost me an additional 70 euros for something that could have been avoided. Clearly there were other passengers that had oversized and overweighted carry on luggage that were not checked. Perhaps it was based on if we appeared to be tourists? Upon check in, the attendant never asked to weight my carry on or told us there may be a random check. Our checked bags were underweight and we could’ve easily transferred some of things to our suitcase. I’ve used many airlines and have never encountered this type of service.

The seats were admittedly economy, but It was Ridiculous how close together the seats were.  Luggage was left in Barcelona.  This year, Venice to Paris, the flight was delayed over 1.5 hours, we were told it was air traffic controller strike.   We arrived in Paris with 15 minutes to get to gate. We made it through customs and to the gate no more than 5 minutes after original gate closure. There were at least 15 passengers impacted. When we arrived at the gate the attendants were still there- but the gate was closed.

First, the lounge set up in Mexico City for Air France sucks.  As to the flight,  the A350-900 is a very nice aircraft, but the amenities did not impress.  The pillow and blanket were cheap.  The service was ok and the attendants were friendly but it still seemed like it as \"phoned in\".  The beef (steak dish), was cool, bland, and just bad.  The eggs in the morning was better.  What really made this trip a bad experience was the fact that Air France chose to overload cargo on this flight and had to leave off ALL passenger luggage.  ( You heard me).  That meant bags, pets, etc.  We were not told.  When we arrived in Paris we were advised that no bags had been loaded because the plane would have been overweight.  EVERYONE had to submit a claim.  I felt bad for those in the back of coach that would have been in a long line.  What made it worse was that they did not update their system so even though they did get the bags out the next evening the claim was not updated til about 4 hours before my bag was delivered to my hotel at 10PM the evening of the next day.

For my departure my luggage was not not loaded on my flight so I went to my home empty handed and waited three days for my luggage. If that was only thing that happened to me on this trip I could have ignored it. BUT in my arrival flights, my route was Delhi to Mumbai to Paris to Vancouver. My Delhi to Mumbai flight was delayed due to incoming flight that was delayed and we reached mumbai one hour late to scheduled time which was fine as we landed at 1:25 and my next flight was at 2:10. I could have taken the flight But your staff stopped us in the middle and told us that we missed the flight even though the flight had not taken off yet. It was later that I got to know that my Mumbai to Paris flight was overbooked. That the staff deliberately stopped us from taking the flight even though we had our boarding passes. Next I had to wait for two full days to my new flight that was allocated to me and for that flight I had to go back to Delhi. WHAT was the point in me coming to Mumbai if I had to go back to Delhi again!!! I had booked my trip 4months earlier so that I can be rest assured that everything will go well. But I did not even get any email that my flight was overbooked and that will be given a new flight ticket. I had to travel 6 hours to reach to Delhi from my home, I think that was enough time that you could have informed me and i would not have waited 2days.

None of the airline is ready to take the initiative to admit their fault.

Months ago we purchased two nonstop tickets from Chicago to Paris. The night before our flight, we got an email that we've been rebooked Chicago&gt;Detroit&gt;Paris, with the first leg being on Delta, the second leg being Air France in Detroit. We were annoyed because we paid for a nonstop ticket, but figured, at least we will still get in Paris, just a few hours after our original itinerary. Well, Delta to Detroit was delayed, and even with 20 of us that got rebooked on that Delta flight in Chicago trying to make the Paris connection, Air France did not wait for us in Detroit. We landed 36 minutes after the scheduled Paris departure. Now, we were stuck for a whole day in Detroit. We had horrible room accommodations, a shuttle that never showed up, and a day wasted on our short itinerary. To make matters worse, there was no one at Detroit airport from Air France (AF) to talk to all day so we tried working through an agent with Delta, but they could not see AF's international flights to help. Since we were now arriving in Paris a whole day later, we had a hotel night we had to pay for, museum tickets purchased in advance we could not use, and dinner reservations with a strict cancellation policy that charged us for not showing, despite our emails and pleas to not charge. Regardless, AF initial decision to bump 20 of us off the original nonstop flight in Chicago to Paris, caused us all to miss a whole day in Paris and cost us hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I made a claim on Air France's website, which they replied to and said because the delay was less than 3 hours, no compensation would be rewarded. What are they even talking about? They clearly did not read our claim, so I called customer service, to which they could only reopen the claim but we cannot talk to anyone on the phone who handles the claims. I pleaded with them on two separate phone calls over two days to please let me talk to someone in claims or customer service or anyone who can help, to which they were very strict in saying there is no one for me to call, I just need to wait another week to hear back by email.

There is no reason they should charge more for a pet than for supplementary luggage. In the end, for a 1h30 flight from Ams to Lyon, my dog will cost more than my ticket. (I paid 188 euros roundtrip; he costs 240 euros). In addition to the excessive charges, I had a very poor experience with their customer service. I had to contact the customer service team three times to address my issue JUST to add my pet!. During my first call, my request was misunderstood, and my dog\\'s weight was mistakenly recorded as 250 kg, leading to the cancellation of my request for the return flight. Despite this error, I received no follow-up communication via email or phone from Air France. Each call required me to take 15-20 minutes out of my workday just to wait for an agent to respond. The second time I called, I was instructed to call back 48 hours later. It is unreasonable to expect customers to repeatedly take time out of their busy schedules to resolve such issues. To boycott, I invite you to systematically write a complaint whenever you have to take your animal with you and pay such a price. I hope it will help change the mentality. If needed, I am pasting here some paragraphs that can help you write your complaint: \"It is important to highlight that such exorbitant fees for traveling with pets contribute to the abandonment of animals, as many pet owners might not afford these additional costs. According to Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), animals are sentient beings, and the welfare requirements of animals should be respected. Charging such high fees and providing inadequate service does not align with this principle and discourages responsible pet ownership. I kindly request that you review this matter and consider adjusting your pet travel policies to be more reasonable and accommodating. Additionally, I urge you to improve your customer service processes to prevent such frustrating experiences in the future. Lowering these fees and enhancing service quality would not only support animal welfare but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.\" I know it takes time for you guys, but I think the more we do it, the more these companies will understand the urgency of changing their policies on animal welfare.

Also, there was mixed messaging as to whether we should get the KLM app or not, and I even heard people at the airport asking if they needed to find KLM or if it was an Air France flight.

Our flight left late but arrived on time (good), but the seats were unusually angled, so both awkward and exposed, the cabin service was average, the entertainment was average and the meals and other alternatives were unexciting.  The worst was the luggage. Our one bag did not arrive. That happens, and at CDG the service to report the missing bag was quick and straightforward. Then came the horrendous problems. Despite promises that the bag would be located and delivered within at worst 48 hours, it was not delivered after 48 hours. An email said it had been located somewhere in the world. Calls to the Air France helpline received sympathy and brush-offs, although they took down the address for delivery after days 1 -3. The WhatsApp bots were just the same: standard expressions of sympathy, and no answers on when anything might happen  We were reassured that we would be contacted before the bag was delivered, but on Day 5 we received an SMS from Chronopost (had to look them up)  out of the blue with a case number. Using that data we found a website that said we had to call a specific number in office hours, and that way we found the bag had been delivered to the hotel we were staying on the day of arrival for our S. Air France's WhatsApp and helpline said they could do nothing - it was not their problem because they had hand-fobbed it off to some other firm.  Two French nationals helped us by calling the number and speaking to the service, but were told that the only possible outcome was delivery to the Day 1 hotel. We had to accept it, so almost a week after leaving we arranged for the bag to be collected from the Day 1  hotel (at our cost...) when it was delivered as promised on Day 7...but it simply was not delivered. No excuses.   Days 8 and 9 were a weekend, and no-one would do anything.  The bag was delivered to the Day 1 hotel on Day 10, even though Air France had been given and duly recorded details of the hotels on later days (with promises that the delivery address would be updated...)  We lodged a claim for the few items we had bought out of necessity. I did not want to put bank account details down on a hotel wifi (and did not have the IBAN numbers, as Australia does not use them), so I lodged a claim as directed... which Air France declared pen by providing a reference number, then promptly closed!!  Over the next three weeks not a single one of my perhaps 20 emails, WhatsApp requests or web-based requests for updates or assistance was answered. However, I did receive almost daily requests to fill out a survey to rate their social media. What a terribly unfunny joke!  Once back in Australia, I rang Air France on a number hidden away in one form. It was the number for tour operators, but the person who answered was good enough to give me the number for the desk handling baggage claims. That desk is open 3 hours a day, 5 days a week (more terrible service), but when i finally found someone they actually helped, and within 24 hours I had another form email promising expenses would be paid if receipts were fully itemised.

I rarely review airlines because they are a necessary evil, and I travel at least once a month to various parts of the world.  I booked to fly to Mexico from London via Paris with a short stop over in CDG.  As I left for the first flight, I got a message to say my connecting flight was delayed by 6 hours.  ‘Oh well’ I thought, suck it up.     The plane took off from LHR on time the pilot made 3 attempts to land in CDG but decided it was too windy.  Other flights were landing though!  He took up to Amsterdam Schiphol and landed there, he made a long announcement in French, nothing in English and we were told to get off quickly and someone would assist us in AMS terminal.   There was no one there!  A whole plane load with elderly and young, just abandoned.  I walked to a different gate and found a bemused KLM staff who tried to help, but all they could do was to say ‘look for an email from Air France’.  It was 6 hours we waited without any support, until an email came to say our flight from London to Paris had been rescheduled til next morning!  Erm, we were in Amsterdam terminal!   An hour later we got a mail telling us to ignore last mail and wait further details.  Around 9 pm we got a mail saying we would travel to Paris next morning at 10am - laughable!    Spent night in a pod in AMS, still no support from Air France, no one to speak to!  So I went to get the 10am flight next day and as I got to the gate, the next message stated it was delayed until 1pm!  This meant I would miss my second day flight to Mexico, so I had to abandon the trip and got KLM to return me to London.    It didn’t end there!  My bag had to be tracked and was later delivered home (good service from the London baggage firm).  I wanted to speak to an Air France rep about compensation and costs.  There was no one in Heathrow, except I found a couple of women at a checkin desk who just shrugged their shoulders and told me to fill in a claim online!     I applied for a refund of my fare through. Virgin Atlantic (who booked the trip).  I got the airfare refunded after 5 weeks with no chance to contact anybody and was told to claim costs and complete from Air France.  Again another form online, no one to speak to!  I was informed by email the flight was cancelled due to weather (not that the pilot was a coward), and no compensation was due, despite twice being informed of long delays and spending 24 hours in Schiphol airport!  They owe me accommodation, costs for cancelled accommodation in Mexico, lost business and for the food and drinks I had to buy at the airport.    They abandoned a whole flight, were uncontactable, ignorant and incompetent.  I shall never fly Air France again as long as I live.

Some French passengers behaved inappropriately, as if they could do anything - embarrassing. Parsonal didn't have a problem with them, and they still joked together in French. I understood them, and they downright slander some passengers who, unlike them, have an upbringing. I have to mention that this flight on May 22, 2024 in the afternoon was terrible.

It’s an airline we’d never tried before, so there were many firsts during this vacation.  We had access to the AF lounges flying from Ottawa to Paris and then on to Bordeaux and back again. The lounges were all excellent, with cheerful, friendly and helpful staff, and good food and drinks.  Once on board the flight to Paris from Ottawa on March 26, the stewards were very professional and friendly, especially Céline, who went above and beyond the call of duty to make us comfortable. Our plane to Paris ran into a long stretch of turbulence, so they had to serve the meal late. Unfortunately, the flight was marred by further turbulence later on, so it was somewhat stressful.  By contrast, the flight home from Paris in an A330 was uneventful. I was able to stretch out for a snooze – I’m over six-foot three, so I consider that to be something of a miracle that I could do that!  The food and drinks on board all four of our flights was as sumptuous as you can imagine for such an airline in business class. Even the short-haul trip to Bordeaux featured a snazzy box lunch with a tasty sandwich and a dessert, all in an elegant rectangular cardboard box. We kept one as a souvenir!

When I was making flight reservations on December 27, 2023 to fly to Paris on September 16, 2024, I discovered Air France Premiere Class and realized Air France had a flight AF 0025 from Los Angeles to Paris on which this class was available.  So I booked flights from Honolulu Hawaii to Paris through the Air France website and paid for Premiere Class to Paris and Business Class on the return;  Premiere Class cost about $6000.00 US more.  On April 19, 2024, I just happened to check our reservations and found that Air France had changed them from Premiere Class to Business Class without notifying me and/or crediting the difference in air fare to my credit card.  So, I called Air France customer service line and tried to alter our reservations to connect with their flight AF 0023 that also went from Los Angeles to Paris, but was told I wasn’t allowed to do that because those Premiere Class seats were for new reservations, not for changes (in spite of the fact that I had paid for the seats four months prior).  I decided that this person had to be a “weekend” person and that I would check again on Monday, April 22, 2024.  In the mean time, the Premiere Class seats were taken by other people.  On Monday, April 22nd, I called again and the gentleman I spoke with did try to find Premiere Class seats, but was unable to find anything that would get us into Paris on September 17 (we have a tour starting) so we changed our flights from the Island of Kauai to Paris through Los Angeles in Business Class, but I am still due my refund of the difference between Premiere Class and Business Class which is about $6000.00.    I called Air France customer service again on May 17, 2024 to at least get a contact phone number for some one who could give me my $6000.00 back.  The young woman I spoke to told that I would not be able to get my money back until I take the flight in September because that is their policy - no other reason.  I asked for some one else I could contact and she gave me an email address to which I sent an email on May 19, 2024 explaining the situation and asked, for the fourth time, for my fare difference back immediately.  The following morning I got a reply by email from Lorenzo, to go back to the customer service phone number that had told me to contact his department.  Basically, giving me the run around.  I am at this point going to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation  that says refunds by airlines are to be given \"promptly\" (within 7 days) and trying to find contact information for the head of Air France North America.  I have been flying for decades and been all over the world, but never been treated this poorly by an Airline.  Quite frankly,  Air France practices fraud as their business model.

It was a disappointing experience. Announcements in English were barely comprehensible, from the Captain to the flight attendants. Why can’t they speak slowly in English when they have such heavy accents?  Seats were quite hard and it was comfortable only when fully reclined. The seat cushions had the feel of economy seating.  Service was above average, so kudos to the flight attendants for their smiles and professionalism. Beverages and food were sub-standard. I was looking forward to their Pommard Champagne, but it was at room temperature pre-departure and during the flight. The same for white wine. I asked the flight attendant about it and he just said “desole, monsieur”. This was a real bummer for me. Why can’t they pre-chill these items which are so iconically French?  For lunch we started with an appetizer of a tiny maybe 2” square plate of cream cheese, hazelnut and pine nut crumble. It was disgusting. Would have preferred nuts. The Shrimp Starter was bland. I selected the Crab and Shrimp Ravioles with Breton curry sauce. The “raviole” was one big ravioli (odd) vs the little square ones I’m used to, and it did not have a heavy seafood taste. The only thing that saved the dish was the wonderful curry sauce. Prior to arrival we had Chicken fillet with tomato sauce, a dish that was fairly dry.  The bread roll was hard and dry, obviously past its prime. The disappointing “dessert” was a Madeleine sponge cake which was a dry spongy mess.

Previously, AF in CPH often checked in my luggage to final destination. However, this service is obviously unpredictable, depending on who sits at the counter. The station manager tried and even took over the checking in. However, eventually she declined as she failed to identify any AF agreement with the concerned (next) airline: Rwandair.

Looking forward to a prompt and proactive response from you regarding this unpleasant situation.]\", \"As an Airline Pilot myself, I understand the frustration that comes with passengers bringing a large quantity of baggage. I also understand the reason airlines prefer less bags and charge for additional weight/pieces. As I booked my parents standby to and from India, we didn't know in advance what airline they would be returning with(along with baggage restrictions) based on loads, until shortly before their return. The issue in this circumstance is that they were charged a total of $980 Canadian for 2 legs which we believe is an unreasonable amount. It appears that Air France has decided to just charge whatever they want to maximize profit with little regard for customer service and a positive experience for guests, especially ones travelling interline. Here is the experience from my parents point of view: Our trip with Air France started in Delhi, India where we were booked to fly to Paris and then to Vancouver on 29th Feb, 2024 Although the Staff at Indian Airport was very friendly, they did charge for extra suitcases for me and my wife, from Delhi to Vancouver at $120 CAD each. We each had a cabin briefcase and a personal item with us which was allowed without any issue. Interestingly my itinerary mentioned the flight departure at 1:45 AM as well as the online check-in, but the boarding pass indicated the time as 5:15 AM. I confirmed the flight time by calling Air France office in Delhi and confirmed the time as 5:15 AM which means that my connecting flight from Paris to Vancouver was no longer an option for me. The Paris-Vancouver flight was already departing by the time we reached Paris. Our son booked us to Vancouver via Los Angeles through Air France and then through WestJet from Los Angeles to Vancouver. The customer service at Paris Airport was the worst we have ever seen. No one was really ready to talk to you if you didn't speak French. While booking our luggage again at Paris to Los Angeles , we were asked to pay for 2nd suitcase again. We showed them the paper that we have already paid for the extra suitcase at Delhi Airport so they let us go. While going through the line for security check we were directed to another place and asked to weigh cabin case and personal bag together and were told that the weight is more than 12kg so we have to go back and book the cabin cases. We tried to explain that we are interline standby travelers and we are already connecting through an Air France flight where it was not an issue, but the person there was not ready to listen to us nor was he talking to us in English. He just kept pushing us to go and book our cabin bags. We had to go back and book our cabin briefcases and they charged us an excessive amount for that (240 Euro for each of the 2 cabin briefcases)   We wanted to talk to someone and raise our concerns but no one was ready to talk to us or listen to us , probably because we were English speaking.  As someone in the industry, I believe it would be hard to justify this amount. I look forward to your response and a chance for Air France to show they do value fairness and most importantly, customer service.

I still won’t be flying Air France again.   ———————————————————- ORIGINAL REVIEW: Absolutely horrible customer service and no way to contact the claims department after illegally denying a valid claim.  They use run-around and ignore tactics so they do not have to pay.  I am sad to say this is the worst airline I have ever encountered.  Even Spirit gets bags to where I am going.    We checked two bags for a trip to Paris with a layover in Heathrow.  Both bags were lost in Heathrow.  One bag was delivered 4 days into the trip.  The 2nd bag was returned to our home 3 weeks later (which we are grateful we actually got it back, from what I am reading from the lost luggage of Air France FB page - check it out for real).  But that was only because my husband went to CDG and spent 2 hours there with the lost luggage department and had them track it down in Heathrow (which was at the end of the trip and then it got sent home).  This is after spending our entire two week vacation buying clothes, shoes, doing laundry, and spending hours calling AF every day to get a status update.   We submitted the claim online as we were instructed to in order to be reimbursed for all the expenses.  The claim was quickly denied because they say it was made more than the 21 allowed time frame from when the bag was delivered.  Very conveniently for them they only looked at the first bag.  We then respond with the information about the 2nd bag, submit all the documentation (which had already been provided).  This is where they ghost you.  Once the claim is closed that is it.  Nothing you do will get you to anyone that can help you.  The phone number which has an option for “check the status of your claim”, one would think that would take you to the claims department, it does not, it takes you to reservations, and they cannot do anything about the claim except for “put a note” on it and there are no supervisors.

No one helped us rebook and we figured out an earlier flight ourselves. Things happen and we got to spend an extra day in Italy so at first we just looked at the positives.   On the way back however, we were supposed to fly out of Napoli airport to Paris for a connecting flight directly to Seattle. They delayed the flight 3 hours, then loaded us all onto a bus to “transport” us all to the airplane that was literally 50ft away. When they loaded us onto a cramped bus after waiting in line for 3 hours, they didn’t actually move the bus for another 30 mins. I literally could have crawled on my hands and knees from where the bus was to where the air plane was in probably 1 min - maybe less. They never should have even scanned our boarding passes unless the plane was ready to go because then we couldn’t even leave the line to use the bathroom or get food without handing a staff member our passport to hold - which at that point I would never trust any of the Air France staff to hold my passport for even 5 mins. We missed our connecting flight to Seattle and had to stay the night in Paris which isn’t as romantic as it sounds. They barely served any water on the 10 hour flight back to Seattle. Upon arriving in Seattle on a Thursday (to no surprise) some of our luggage was missing. Air France said they would deliver the missing luggage to our home within 24 hours. After several follows and Air France telling us they put the luggage and 4 different planes, to only admit it actually didn’t get on any of the planes, they told us on SUNDAY that they didn’t know where the luggage was, what country it was even in, but that “rest assured they would email us when it’s on the way.” We called Delta to complain and then within 5 mins they located the bag and said it had arrived in Seattle on Friday and had been sitting there since then. They said they would have some staff from Air France ship it to which we said absolutely not and that we would just drive to the airport to get it ourselves because we didn’t want them touching our stuff anymore.   If I could give this airline less than a 1 star I would. They completely took away from the refreshed and elated feeling you get from taking time off work and coming back from vacation.

On the return flight, I chose an aisle seat so that I could get served first. On the first flight the attendant ALWAYS asked the person sitting in aisle FIRST. The second flight there was a racist older white female flight attendant with braids. What I found very discriminatory and racist was that the female flight attendant with the braids would ONLY ask the white lady passenger who sat in the middle seat FIRST what she wanted to eat or drink. She would ONLY greet her and her husband that sat by the window and never greet me.  I found this to be odd since I was sitting closest to her and I should have been asked first (As I observed in all my previous flights). The flight attendant would ONLY address that passenger as \"Madame\" which she never addressed me. The flight attendant would ONLY tell the white lady \"Merci.\" When I told the flight attendant \"Thank you\" she said NOTHING TO ME. This is discriminatory behavior and should be addressed.  I have never been on a flight ever where they skipped the aisle person and asked the middle person FIRST. It\\'s because the woman sitting in the middle seat was white and the flight attendant thought she was more important than I.  I am sitting in the aisle seat and making eye contact with the flight attendant, AND SHE BLANTANTLY IGNORED ME AND ONLY SERVED THE WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE SEAT BEFORE ME FIRST, THEN ASKED ME SECOND THAT IS DISCIMINATION EVERY SINGLE time they gave out drinks, breakfast and lunch.  She treated me like a second class citizen as if I were \"less than\" which is probably why she only asked the white lady what drink she wanted or food she wanted first even though she was in the middle seat. And yes, I was making eye contact and ready to give my order to her but she IGNORED ME. This is discrimination. Disgusting what type of people they hire.]', 'Air France goes down as the worst airline I have ever flown with. Our family flies internationally multiple times per year and we have never had an experience like this. First, we booked extra leg room seats and paid extra for them($400) 6 months in advance. About a month before the trip, they moved our seats and separated me and my husband in the back of the plane(with no refund, mind you) due to “operational reasons”. We logged in to see all the seats are clearly open so their “operational reasons” were a lie. We moved them again and paid again to have the same seats. They then move us the day of check-in due to “operational reasons” and this time at least refund us(only for the second time, we have still not received a refund for the first time). We were not surprised to see someone else seated in our seats we paid for when we got on the plane (supposedly they give them to whoever they prefer). On top of that, they made us check in our carry on because they have the worst space for carry on luggage I have ever seen on any plane. The one they did allow us to carry on, we had to put many rows behind us due to having no space anywhere near our seats. We made it there to Naples to find out that our luggage did not make the flight and will be coming sometime the next day.   The luggage may be Air France’s issue or our previous airline’s issue so I’ll let that one slide. We got our luggage about 4 days into our trip.   The biggest issue was on the way back. We checked in around 12:30 PM for our flight the next day at 12:35 PM. 8 hours later, my husband only receives an e-mail(mind you, they have our phone number, my email, and we both also have the app and we received no notifications) that our flight has been cancelled and we are rebooked on a flight 6 1/2 hours earlier!! They had also touched our ticket and thus our other airlines could no longer check us in for the other flights on our itinerary or even move other flights on our itinerary. This left us with a 6 hour layover that we could not change through Delta. We ended up not being able to sleep at all because we did not discover this change until midnight due to no notifications and had to immediately pack and leave our hotel.  When we arrived at our boarding gate, I was then pulled(on no sleep already!) aside for a second security check 20 minutes before take-off because they booked our tickets last minute and made us look suspicious since it was no longer a two way international ticket!!!  Please, if you have any regard for your travel, do not book Air France. They made a horrible end to our trip.]', 'So, I was separated from my wife and made to sit 2 rows from her on this flight.  Three months before, we were together but somehow, AF decided to separate us today.  The reason - my seat next her was blocked for some technical problem.  We boarded, sat down, and voila, some Frenchman takes the blocked seat.  Apparently, he was upgraded or was using points, so they elected for him to use the seat.  Apparently the audio was not working on that seat.    I asked them if they thought that was \"good business practices\" and of course, the flight manager, did not have a clue of what I was referring so.

Selecting and sticking with an airline is a challenge. Here's why I started with Air France &amp; Delta and switched to United for my 20+ international flights and 30+ flights inside the EU:  1. Use Air France and Transavia side EU for holidays and business: not recommended, expensive, tired old planes that you get bussed to and climb a staircase to board 2. Enjoy better service and French food: sub-par, tons of attitude, language and culture barrier, and Unided staff will go above and beyond if you are nice to them.  2.  Get to premier class fast and enjoy the perks: it takes WAY longer, and very unfriendly policies like - locking the seat map 48-24hrs before check-in - making passengers pay for things that come standard with United - wiping out seat selection when changing aircraft  - lounge access and flight availability are generally better with United  Loyalty is a two-way street, passengers are still just a number to airlines, but if you will travel frequently, make sure you give your $$$ to someone who cares a bit more.]\", \"Air France is seriously pushing me to jetison my loyalty to their Flyinig Blue program with increasingly mediocre service, like that which I experienced between Dubai and Paris on AF655. The Sky Team lounge in Dubai is frankly disgusting--shabby, poorly located, and with really terrible food and cheap wines, low-grade alchol, etc. If Air France wants to compete against Emirates it sseriously needs to up its game.    Aboard flight 655, the stewardesses did not greet passengers or hang their coats on boarding. The 'snack' served in lieu of dinner was frankly disgusting--a proper meal should have been an option in business class, and no further beverage service was offered after the meal was served. Breakfast was rushed, becuase the stewardesses waited too late to serve, and the one serving me had to be asked for bread and pastries and never bothered offering jam. These are details, but when you pay extra for business class you expect a much better level of service and amenities.     Finally, Charles de Gaulle terminal 2E is one of the most disorganised and poorly designed air terminals in the world! Plus staff is aggressively rude. Next time I will fly Turkish Airlines or Emirates, both of which offer much much better business class than Air France, a company that has been ruined by obvious cost cutting everywhere.]\", 'I have paid for premium economy round trip.

With that horrible experience I don’t think so I will be flying with them again]', \"A Disappointing Journey  As an Iranian traveler, I recently had an unfortunate experience with Air France that left me feeling stressed, frustrated, and disheartened. Let me share my story in the hope that it serves as a cautionary tale for fellow passengers.  Booking Process and Lack of Transparency  When I booked my flight from Mumbai to São Paulo via Paris and operated by eight France itself , I trusted Air France to provide a seamless journey. However, upon arriving at Mumbai airport, I was blindsided by the revelation that I couldn't proceed to São Paulo through Paris due to a transit visa requirement. The shock and confusion were overwhelming. Here's where Air France fell short:  1. Misleading Information: Nowhere during the ticket booking process did Air France mention the need for a transit visa. As a result, I found myself stranded at the airport, unable to continue my journey.  2. Stress and Racism:  The lack of clear communication caused immense stress. Moreover, I felt discriminated against, as if my nationality played a role in their decision. No passenger should endure such treatment.  Denied Boarding and Financial Loss  1. Denied Boarding: Air France left me with no choice but to cancel my ticket. Imagine the frustration of being at the airport, ready to fly, only to be turned away due to an oversight by the airline.  2. Inadequate Refund:  To add insult to injury, the refund process was a nightmare. Out of the ₹ 75360 I paid, I received a paltry ₹ 4369 back. This discrepancy is entirely unjust and unacceptable.  Passenger Rights and EU 261  1. EU 261:  As an EU-based airline, Air France is subject to EU 261 regulations. These rules protect passengers' rights in cases of flight disruptions, including denied boarding due to visa issues.  2. Compensation:  I urge Air France to honor its obligations under EU 261. Compensation should not be a mere formality; it's a matter of fairness and respect for passengers.  What Air France Can Do  1. Transparency: Air France must improve transparency during the booking process. Clearly communicate visa requirements to passengers, ensuring they make informed decisions.  2. Fair Compensation:  Refund policies should be fair and consistent. Passengers deserve more than a fraction of their hard-earned money back.  Conclusion  My experience with Air France was disheartening. I implore the airline to rectify its practices, treat passengers equitably, and uphold the standards expected of a reputable carrier.

The food was delicious, staff was extremely helpful and friendly. No cancellations or delays. Everything went extremely smoothly. 10/10 would fly it again.]', 'My recent experience with Air France left me deeply dissatisfied and frustrated. As a frequent business traveler, I value efficiency and respect for customers. Unfortunately, my encounter with Air France at Charles de Gaulle Airport was anything but.  After a long journey that involved multiple flights, I faced an unexpected hurdle at the Air France check-in counter. Despite my baggage being only slightly over the weight limit, I was met with arrogance and inflexibility from the staff. The \"manager\" on duty, accompanied by a dismissive colleague, insisted that I pay a hefty fee for a mere 1kg overweight in my hand luggage. When I suggested redistributing the weight within my checked baggage, I was met with a cold refusal.  The interaction took a disrespectful turn when, after mentioning my profession as a pilot, the staff openly laughed and made derogatory remarks in French. This unprofessional behavior continued when I tried to seek refuge in the Air France lounge during my long layover, only to be met with insincere hospitality and a thinly veiled acknowledgment of the prior encounter.  This experience has left me deeply disappointed in Air France\\'s customer service and handling of situations. Not only was I subjected to unnecessary charges, but the staff\\'s unprofessional conduct was disheartening. As a result, I will be avoiding Air France for my future travels and will not recommend their services to colleagues or friends.  My company who employs in excess of 75 crew who fly onto base and home every 2 months were also notified and alternative airline will be used in the future.]', 'Wonderful.

After our original flight was canceled, we were left unattended for a grueling 24 hours at France's airport, confined to our wheelchairs. Despite our obvious need for assistance, no one from the airline bothered to check on us or offer any help. To make matters worse, the atmosphere at the airport was dismal, with staff displaying blatant racism and mistreatment towards us. This entire ordeal was not only physically exhausting but also emotionally draining. We argued many times that we were already sick and walking with oxygen machines, but our pleas were ignored. We spent the entire night in misery, with nowhere to rest. Since returning from this trip, both my companion and I have been battling pneumonia, which we believe was exacerbated by the neglect and mistreatment we endured. We strongly advise against using Air France or France's airport. The lack of basic human decency and respect shown by both entities is appalling. We urge anyone considering flying with them to think twice and choose an airline that values their customers' well-being.]\", \"I typically don't leave negative reviews of airlines even though I've had a fair few bad experiences, because... what's the point? But I have to share this experience with Air France which was so bad from check-in that I wanted to skip my trip altogether.   Upon arrival, they notified me of a strict carry-on bag weight policy (26.4 pounds). Having been unaware of this, I spent an hour shuffling and re-arranging so as to check my backpack and keep my larger bag. Satisfied, they let me pass to security, sans backpack.   Once at the gate, a gate attendant randomly selected me to be pulled aside for a check. He lifted my bag with his bare hand and proclaimed it to be too heavy. I objected, as I had made it through check-in and he was not using an instrument to measure. Another attendant brought over a baggage scale and concurred that it was too heavy, not showing me what the reading on the scale was. I resorted to shoving my multiple medications, travel chargers, laptop, business papers, valuables, and a few toiletries into a shopping bag to bring on board. When I asked if the contents of my carry-ons would be reimbursed in full if they did not arrive at my destination, the attendant shrugged and said I'd have to call the company and ask.  Buyer beware: If you choose this airline, don't pack anything of value that can't fit into a pocket. You may not be able to bring it on board.  P.S.

For three hours, there was no communication from AirFrance as to what was going on. - Then we were finally told that we would be getting a different plane at a different terminal and had to schlep ourselves on the tram to the new terminal and find our own way.  No help was available from AirFrance employees, who, even when I asked one point blank to his face just ignored me as if he did not see me and that I had not spoken. Incredibly Rude. - We finally got on the plane after a 4 1/2 hour delay only to find they had not finished prepping the second plane (to get \"fresher food\"), so we sat on the tarmac for another 30 minutes.  - Our 1:25 PM flight FINALLY left at 6:00PM. - On this flight, we found that the \"fresher food\" did not include anywhere near enough portions, so approx 40% of the plane had to settle for whatever they had.

I just threw mine away after a taste because it was just awful. - The second \"meal\"/\"snack\" was also inedible and looked like rejects from a very cheap restaurant. Tossed that one, too. - So, no food on this flight. - The flight announcements in French came first (Ok), and were always considerably longer that the ones in English that followed.  And the \"English\" was SO bad that the announcements (which, who knows, might have contained valuable info) were mainly incomprehensible. Not just me - we were all looking at each other and asking \"Did YOU understand that?\" - Considering this plane contained mainly US tourists returning from France, they really should have at least looked for someone for whom English was not such an insurmountable challenge!  What if we could not understand important safety info?  Does the FAA know or care about this? Or have any jurisdiction? - The flight attendants displayed a clear bias in looking down their noses at us Americans, and deliberately either misunderstanding what we said, or simply ignoring us entirely.

Then, at Dulles in DC, at the luggage carousel, my husband\\'s suitcase comes out. But mine never does. We stood for one hour waiting; mine never arrived.   Turns out, it never got put on the plane in France. The crew knew the whole 8 hours and never told me. Neither my age (70) nor my flight cabin (business class) mattered to them. They let a 70-year old woman stand at the carousel for an hour for NO good reason. So much for respect for their customers.  We had Apple Air Tags in both checked suitcases. So that night and the next morning we called Air France. They finally admitted it had been put on a Delta flight to Detroit and then made it to Dulles Friday morning.

But they neglected to tell him that their office doesn\\'t open/isn\\'t staffed until 1pm. While he was going there, I called AF and got a similar runaround from a person who probably isn\\'t even an AF employee. He had zero interest in rectifying their error and in solving the problem in a timely, decent way.   At the luggage claim office, AF insisted it was not at Dulles and we\\'d have to wait for an email later to say when it might arrive. Despite his telling them our Air Tag proved it was quite close to their luggage office.

I replied, \"Because that\\'s where the bag is, the Air Tag proves it\".)   Turns out my bag was at the Delta Luggage Office, right next to AFrance\\'s. My husband went next door.

They charged me $175 for an overweight of 3kg.They are always looking for ways to suck up customers blood. This is my first nd last time taking it.]', 'While the flight itself was reasonably on-time considering the rainy weather, the overall business class experience bordered on miserable due to AF ground operations at CDG Terminal 2E.   Just about everything was poor following Sky-Priority checkin, including an unimpressive Sky-Priority lounge.  Finding the almost-hidden entry to the Sky-Priority security lane nestled between postions 7 and 8 was a challenge. Next, all three non-EU electronic passport stations were not working because the software kept rebooting.  Staff redirected passengers to a long manual queue.   The x-ray line was overcrowded and understaffed contributing to more delays.  But the worst part was learning that the flight would use a bus gate at K52 to take passengers to a plane parked at another terminal.  Jammed into busses, both business and economy passengers  endured a 15 minute ride to the plane only to have to walk up three flights of stairs with their carry-on baggage.  After a long wait on an overcrowded jetway to the plane, exhausted sweaty customers were greeted by sympathetic flight crew who promised that the flight itself would be better which it was.   It’s truly sad to that an otherwise good flight would be marred by such ground experiences which seem to be ongoing.   If you’re traveling in AF business class from CDG 2E, my advice is simple: allow lots of time and gird yourself.]', 'Racist company with poor customer service.

However, that\\'s not what has caused me to write a review.   Having flown business class for the last 5 years, I was genuinely shocked when I was refused access to the lounge because I had purchased a \"Business light fare\". I have never heard of such a thing and certainly wasn\\'t made aware of this at booking. The staff were adamant that it was clear on their website. The only problem was, I didn\\'t book directly through the AF website. I can assure you there was no mention on the site of this fare and there was also no mention of it on the AF app or emails. The only place it could be found was in small print on the boarding pass.   What a terrible idea to introduce this product and not make it very clear to anyone purchasing it that it was a different fare. To rub salt into the wound, I had to pay for seat selection and lounge access.   The lounge at CDG was below average. Poor quality food, very basic facilities and very crowded. Certainly not worth £75.   I won\\'t be flying with Air France again. Overall a terrible experience from start to finish.]', 'They aren’t the best ever but I can see the potential there.

I called them had to wait almost an hour to get to an agent. The lady who answered told me to add the info about what’s in my bag. So I had again to fill another form (2nd one) to enumerate the items in my bag. It’s been another week now and still no news from them. They are the worst customer services airline I ever dealt with!

But Diamond members with Skyteam apparently mean nothing. Stick with delta because they show us no consideration.   My trip actually began in DC, i took a delta airlines flight to JFK and no problems until it was time to leave for Paris. I get to the gate an am asked for my Visa for Kenya. I informed the gate agent it was all over the news that visas were not required anymore. For 45 minutes I went back and forth showing how other passengers where able to travel prior to me with no problems, and how on previous flights with AF and even KLM I’ve traveled with no visa in the past. Nope still not able to board and when i even checked my bag location i found they already removed my luggage meaning they already selected me to not board. I had already paid for upgraded seats and had important business to get to in Nairobi.   I am told i need to leave the area and see ticketing, they say we can rebook you tomorrow, but if you denied me today wouldn’t it be the same tomorrow? Or was it another reason I couldn’t travel? I tell the lady send me to Tanzania, i have an active multi visa there so this doesn’t happen tomorrow. And i book a one way from there myself on Kenya airways to Nairobi.   I call the complaint customer service line and all they do is keep saying it’s my fault, nobody at the airline took ownership. I arrived on a connecting flight 5 hour in advance i wont late. So im stuck in NY and had to get a hotel, my bags were somewhere in the airport and i was told they would be on the plane when i left the next morning it was confirmed. I track them and they never left NY. I get to Amsterdam and they say i have to file a complaint at my final destination.   I eventually arrive in Tanzania and with no issues whatsoever board my flight to Kenya meaning this was all for nothing but a waste of my time money and resources.   When i arrive in Kenya i file my bag claim and they arrive 3 days late, damaged and destroyed.   I was in Kenya a month so until i returned to the US i had to wait to address my concerns more vigorously. I attempted to dispute the seat upgrades i never received with no success. I attempted to recover my extra flight with Kenya airlines with no success. I also tried to recover the damaged costs for my bags and as of yesterday was told (even though Kenya airways is Skyteam) it had to be a KLM DELTA AF claim with made 0 sense. The report was received and you sent my bags on an AF flight the claim made no impact of my situation.   So to date i was told you are welcome to fly on another AF flight and get your seat credit (after you buy another ticket and spend more money) I would rather change airlines and develop status and loyalty with another airline before i travel on another AF flight.   Now the above are 100% the fault of AF. I have no doubt in my mind they were oversold and are covering up this fact and involuntarily tried bumping my seat and are not taking ownership for this issue. So my message to anyone reading this, the above statements are factual. I had everything, was on time, the airline didn’t let me travel and as a result caused a lot of issues with my travel. I missed interviews, meetings and wasted money on travel and expenses extra. Have destroyed luggage, a credit supposedly that isn’t showing that will never get used (but if they are not at fault why do i have a credit) Be careful when booking with this specific airline. The way they handled me when they were responsible for the entire experience above could be you. I was fortunate to have major credit cards and able to buy tickets, hotels etc. other people in recent times were stuck at airports at the airlines mercy.

She then told me to sit in a regular economy aisle seat and I asked how I could get my refund for the extra fee I had already paid.

The agent said they need to send a manual calculation (what difference needs to be paid) and I will receive an email within 12 - 48 hrs. I waited and never received an email as mentioned. I asked if my ticket price would change and they said \"NO\". Then I again called on 1/12 (call took 1.30 hr+ (45 mins to connect and 30+mins to discuss with agent)) and was told the same. Need to do the manual calculation by a different team and I will receive the email in 12-48hrs. I again asked if my price will change and they said \"NO\". It should be recorded in our call.

So I was requesting to connect to the manager for further discussion as I am not responsible to pay the increase in fare because the fault was not on me. The fault was on the air France team as they did not do the manual calculation in a timely manner as they said which caused this increase in fare, even after me calling multiple times to get an update.

So, I booked the flight. Then they canceled the pet request because the layover was not long enough. So, the agent books a different flight, and they cancelled that one because the plane on one leg of the flight did not allow more than one pet in hold. After literally 20 phone calls, and 20 hours of my time attempting to book a flight with my pets, it occurred to me that there are zero flights from Chicago to Turin that will accomodate them. I asked if there were any flights to any nearby airports, and the agents were unable to find even one. I asked for a refund, due to my being given false information regarding travel with pets on this route, they refused, because the 1k flight was non-refundable. I ended up asking which type plane allows more than one pet, and I was able to research and find a flight myself, going into Bologna..... a 5-6 hour drive from where I needed to be. Also keep in mind, when traveling with pets, you must remove your them from the carrier goong through security, or put them through an x-ray machine designed for non-living items. However in Paris, unlike other airports, they do not have a room to remove your pets in, so if your cat doesn't appreciate going back in the carrier, good luck. Luckily my cat ultimately was more afraid of the airport, than he was the carrier, so I only had a few scratches. Then, upon attempting to board the second leg of the flight in Paris, they weighed my carry on PLUS my purse together, and was told it was 1kg to heavy, and I needed to check the carry-on bag.  Except the bag contained a 3k camera and 2k worth of medication, and all my pet supplies, none of which I could ditch. I asked them to document the expensive contents and was told the medicine and pet supplies would be okay, but it would be best not to check the camera. So clearly they are aware their own employees are thieves, and they still work there? Finally a manager came out and made an exception for me to carry it in cabin. However, this process took so long, I missed the connecting flight. So, they had to remove my 60 pound dog and my cat, that were already checked into cargo, and I had to wait in the airport with all 3 of them for an additional 4 hours until the next flight. Of course, they tried to charge me a flight change fee, but as my voice got louder, they decided to do me a huge favor and waive that. Now, I land in Bologna at 23:30, and the rental car was closed, so not only did I pay a day for a rental car that I didn't have, I had to take a $100 cab to a $200 hotel room, then another $100 cab back to the airport in the morning to rent a car, for my 5 hour drive to Turin with 3 animals. On top of this, one of my checked bags didn't make it to Bologna. I suppose I should be grateful they even found it. I received an email on 5 March, stating my bag arrived at Bologna airport. I made arrangments for it to be delivered on 10 March, because although my daughter lives in Bologna and could pick it up, we would still have to get it to Torino. After waiting all day, the bag did not arrive. So, I called Air France to see why it wasn't delivered, and was told my bag was enroute to Bologna from Paris? Then the next day, they told me it did actually arrive on the 5th, so I asked them again to deliver it. They told me they handed it to ONX courier, who will contact me. It us now 14 March, and no word from the courier. I had asked for the courier phone number, and they gave me 2 numbers, one of which is out of service, and one they don't answer. AF refuses to give me an email so that I can contact the company myself, but assured me they would email them, but today they told me the company never responded to the email. So, today 14 March, I called AF and asked that they get my bag back from the courier, and I will take a day to go to Bologna to retrieve it there. Of course, they again emailed the company that clearly has zero employees to answer it. It won't long before it can be deemed lost. Been there, and anyone who has been there can tell you this will entail hours locating receipts and making spreadsheets, only to be told the value of your items are 1/10 of what it would cost to replace them, and if you don't have receipts, you are out of luck (because you know everyone just wants to rip off these honest, ethical airlines when THEY lose YOUR luggage). Bottom line, I am sure this is a perfectly fine Airline to fly international, as long as you do not have pets or checked baggage, as their agents are ill-informed regarding pets, and even if they find your bag after they lost it, they will hand it to a courier that doesn't deliver your bag, answer their phone, or respond emails. After this total nightmare, where my poor cats were traumatized after being crated for 24 hours in urine soaked carriers (I uploaded a photo of one of them, around hour 20), I realize I would have literally saved 50 hours of time, and 1k, had I simply re-booked with a different airline,  cancelling the Air France flight all together, with no refund.]\", \"The flight was late leaving EDI. The co-pilot appeared to be arguing with ground staff about some problem. This may not have been the airline's fault. Ground crew re positioned air-stairs and eventually we boarded. The plane interior was averagely clean. Disappointing after Emirates and Etihad. When the back wheels touched the runway in CDG it occurred to me that the nose was still high. Sure enough, the pilot aborted landing and we had to go around. This may well have been the best and safest thing to do but it meant we lost 20 minutes. This meant out time on the ground was shorter than planned to make out connecting flight.. Our bags, despite being business priority missed the connecting AF flight to Toulouse. It was around lunchtime so maybe ground crew went on lunch.  AF service in TLS was non-existent. Worked my way around entering a contactless form into a terminal. Got an email late in the day saying our bags are on the way late that night and would be available for collection the following day after 9am. I went back to the terminal, after 9 the following morning and was advised by staff that the bags were due in TLS later that day. They insisted the email I had received was wrong.

Then on my return, there was a delay on my flight from India to Paris, so they unilaterally decided to route me through SINGAPORE which not only added 20 hours to my flight, but meant that I would miss my connecting flight home to Halifax. Again, not one word from Air France with an offer of assistance or even apology. Finally - today when I sought a claim to compensate for the hundreds of dollars lost AT THEIR EXPENSE - Air France denied any responsibility or compensation because of some obscure law that says my flight was not within the EU so they gave me the middle finger for all my discomfort.

The glass of champagne as pre-dinner drink was OK, but the wine served with the meal (white) was nothing short of a disgrace for a company pretending to be French and to showcase the country\\'s food and wine tradition of excellence.

At 24hours notice the schedule was deferred by 3.5 hours, yet AF issued what I view as a false \"certificate\" stating the inbound arrival was only 11 minutes late.

At Helsinki check in the attendant helped make sure everything was arranged for the flight back as well. Helsinki staff was great. When I got to the gate in Paris for the flight back to Helsinki I was denied preboarding because their staff wasn’t there to take my chair down to cargo. I explained I have mobility issues and a heart condition and couldn’t navigate the aisle with other people around. The gate agent told me it didn’t matter. I attempted to board with my group anyway and he took and refused to return my passport to prevent me from boarding. I was desperate to get aboard and knew I wouldn’t be able to if I waited (they continued boarding while I had this conversation so about 50 people were already on the bridge). So I said you can keep my passport until they come but I’m going now and went. A few minutes later he followed me and reluctantly gave me my passport and said I was allowed to board but had to take the batteries out. I just said “I know how to fly with a wheelchair” and continued.

I told them okay. I have the confirmation from PayPal and also I have confirmation on my bank statement that they took out the full payment for the luggage and still they wouldn't fix the issue. Finally 3 days before my flight I had to call again and they finally put it on my ticket that I had paid for it. Then at the airport they give me many additional security screenings and at the Paris airport they weigh your carry-on bags that includes the backpack I had and my small carry-on luggage which has to be under 12 kg. Mine was 14 so I either had to pay $400 to check the bag. The small carry-on luggage bag or throw away all my clothes so I ended up having to throw away all my clothes because I don't have an extra $400 laying around to spare for a small luggage. No other airline or airport has this type of insanity where they weigh your carry-on bags, including your purse or your backpack and your personal item on the plane. Only Air France does this and only the Paris airport. Does this no other airline ways even your personal items and then tries to charge you $400 to check it. Also the Air front staff is always rude except for the staff on the plane like the flight attendants. But the in airport staffs and any airport are always very rude and they don't like to help be helpful or give information. All the Air France flights leak condensation from the top. This happened on all Air France planes to and from my destination. Go look at the reviews for Air France and you will see that everyone that's posted in the past years had a terrible experience with Air France, planes, travel and employees and customer service.

This lack of communication and poor handling of seating arrangements added unnecessary stress to the journey.\\nDiscriminatory Treatment on the Plane\\nDuring the flight, my group and I experienced what felt like discriminatory treatment, simply because we are Muslims.

How is this acceptable for Premium Economy?\\n\\nThe halal food served was absolutely inedible. It was bland, tasteless, and had no care put into its preparation. To add insult to injury, there was no juice or any beverage accompanying the meal. Meanwhile, other non-Muslim passengers were served well-presented meals. The stark contrast in service was appalling.\\n\\nBut what really broke my heart was the blatant racism my mother and I faced. We were wearing hijabs, and it was clear from the way we were treated that the staff’s behavior toward us was harsh and discriminatory.

It wasn’t about “unpleasant smells” or minor discomforts, as the airline’s dismissive response suggested—it was about my assigned seat being taken over by two other passengers, one of whom even laid down in my seat after I was forced to move!\\n\\nDespite my repeated requests for help, the flight attendant refused to intervene or enforce seating protocol. I had to move to another seat while they completely disregarded my rightful place. This wasn’t just an inconvenience; it felt like a blatant disregard for my experience as a paying customer.\\n\\nAnd when I contacted Air France afterward, hoping they’d address this serious lapse? Their response was both dismissive and inaccurate. Instead of acknowledging the real problem—a violation of basic seating rules and lack of crew intervention—they responded as if my concern was about a “passenger with strong perfume.” It was as if they hadn’t even read my complaint! This kind of indifference to a genuine customer issue is unacceptable and disappointing.\\n\\nI’m left wondering: is this how Air France treats all customers, or was my experience ignored because of my background? Either way, I felt humiliated, unheard, and completely disregarded by an airline that claims to prioritize customer satisfaction.\\n\\nTo any potential Air France passengers: think twice before booking with them if you value your comfort, respect, and peace of mind.

When we arrived at the check-in counter, we waited over two hours just to receive our boarding passes. Then, only an hour before the flight, they informed us that our pre-selected seats had been changed due to a \"problem.\" They assured us the new seats would have extra legroom, though two out of five seats would lack screens. Since we had no other flight options, we reluctantly accepted.\\n\\nOnce we boarded, we discovered our original seats, which had a “problem,” were sold to other passengers—even though we booked the flight three months ago. The new seats were far from an upgrade. Two of them were actually intended for staff, with no screens, no USB ports, and awkwardly positioned in the middle of the aisle—not ideal for a 13-hour flight. Because of this awkward placement, passengers frequently stepped on my foot whenever they passed by to use the restroom. To make matters worse, a sick passenger sat next to me, and I ended up getting sick as well.\\n\\nWhen I raised these issues with a flight attendant, I mentioned that I had paid for Sky Priority to select my seat because this was a long flight and I have sleeping problems. She dismissed my concerns, saying, “You will get refund,” and walked away while I was still speaking. The same attendant later bumped into my knee with her drink cart multiple times and even stepped on my foot without apologizing.

There is NOBODY accountable at Air France and they intentionally make it impossible to escalate - no senior manager to talk to - no replies to emails or claim tickets - no support at headquarters .  They violate passenger rights outright and use these tactics to avoid their liabilities.  The only thing left is litigation.  Too bad for the otherwise excellent work of their cabin crews and flight crews.  I am especially fond of KLM.

Took the second flight next morning and that made my ear even worse with the air pressure and due to anxiety I became very uneasy, but when u have flight attendants with zero empathy...well instead of deescalating they further added stress to my experience.

I am writing after receiving an unsatisfactory respond to my claim to formally express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received during my recent flight with Air France. This has been one of the most dehumanizing and uncomfortable experiences I’ve ever had on a flight. The flight code was AF116, on August 1 and my seat number was 9A. As a loyal customer who has flown with your airline multiple times, I was deeply disappointed by the experience I encountered on this occasion in business class.\\n\\nFirstly, my service ring was ignored multiple times, while the crew was chatting and walking around, which made me feel overlooked and unvalued as a passenger. Additionally, I was not addressed by name or even welcomed, while seeing other passengers around me being greeted, further contributing to an impersonal experience. One particular stewardess handed out welcome drinks to other passengers while calling them sir or madam and when she came to me, she said nothing and frowned at me. The storage area was difficult to open, its corners were peeling, which is unacceptable for a new plane. I also noticed that my dinner arrived significantly late while others around me and in the same row were served first, leaving me feeling insulted and baffled. The most humiliating and ridiculous thing was that, a stewardess attempted to refill an empty plastic water bottle (that was single use and should have been taken away) without my request, causing a spill that stained my seat and the floor, I was horrified. Despite asking twice for dessert, my request was met with inconsistent responses, and I felt that my needs were not taken seriously. I paid €38 for Wi-Fi, expecting reliable service, but the connection was disappointingly slow, making streaming impossible. Additionally, I found all crew members to be passive-aggressive with disgusted looks on their faces, and treated other French passengers significantly warmer. During dinner, my tablecloth was carelessly thrown onto my tray by a condescending crew, an action I found to be disrespectful. Upon leaving the aircraft, no one greeted me, which reinforced a feeling of hostility and discrimination throughout my flight. It was also concerning that none of the staff wore name tags, leaving me unable to identify those who contributed to my unfortunate experience. At the lounge, the staff did not extend a welcoming demeanor, simply pointing to machines rather than offering assistance, which they did for other passengers and when I spoked to them, the response was rude. Overall I was treated differently to other passengers and which I deem to be racial discrimination.\\n\\nGiven this series of unsettling events, I am requesting a formal apology from Air France, along with a half refund for the discomfort I experienced during my flight, which is unacceptable even for economy, let alone business class. I have received a very brief response from the China office which I find very dismissive and am not satisfied with. I trust that you value your customers and will take this complaint seriously. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

I asked to be seated elsewhere but was just told the plane is full and kids are like that. I thought the reply from the flight attentendant was rude as there could have been an easy solution as the father of the kicking child was sitting next to his wife and the passenger next to me with the baby thought it was normal that kids kick, so if the passengers behind me had swaped seats we all could have been happy, but my concerns were completely dismissed. \\nWhile I can appreciate that these sorts of experiences are somewhat subjective, the flight to Frankfurt from Paris was even worse as the plane was completely dirty - the ventilation areas had black spots that returned a wet wipe black and next to the seats were week old crumbs and dirt. I asked for help with more wipes but had to wait for the wipes for almost the entire duration of the flight.

After takeoff, I noticed multiple empty seats, and some passengers were able to stretch out and sleep comfortably. I, however, was still forced to stay in my seat next to the sick passenger.\\n\\nWhen I asked the flight attendant again after takeoff about changing my seat, she spoke in French to another attendant and a passenger near the bathroom, completely ignoring me.

On the outbound journey, we booked premium economy with KLM. The service was so good that we decided it was likely to be similar with Air France, so we opted to upgrade to business class for the return leg.\\n\\nRegrettably, our assumption that the service would match KLM’s standard couldn’t have been further from the truth. Contrary to what was stated on the Air France website, the 777 we flew on still had the old business class seats. The seats were not clean, and I had to use Dettol to wipe everything down myself. Additionally, the seats appeared worn and in poor condition. I find it extremely unfair that Air France has essentially created a lottery regarding which aircraft have been refitted and which haven’t, while still charging the same fare.\\n\\nWe decided to make the most of the situation and relax with a movie, but even that wasn’t possible. The entertainment system froze repeatedly, making it impossible to watch films or listen to audio.\\n\\nAfter lunch, I didn’t see a flight attendant in the business class cabin for several hours. Unlike the KLM flight where constant refreshments were offered in premium economy, no such service was provided by Air France. When we did ask, the older male flight attendant seemed visibly frustrated by the request, which made us feel like a nuisance. Despite pressing the call bell, the flight attendants either didn’t come, walked straight past, or took 20 minutes to respond, only after being flagged down. We spent the entire flight thirsty. I later found the flight attendants sitting around, laughing in the mid-galley with the curtains drawn. Eventually, I was told I could help myself to a banana and an orange from the forward galley and pour my own water. From that point on, it felt like the business class cabin was practically abandoned, with passengers getting up and helping themselves.\\n\\nWhen dinner was finally served, it was rushed due to turbulence. The meal was basic, accompanied by warm, flat Coke, and no alcohol was offered. The reason given was that the turbulence didn’t allow enough time to serve drinks, but I don’t buy into that. From my knowledge of aviation, pilots would have been warned about the turbulence through TAF reports and ride reports from other pilots.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it’s a real shame that KLM has partnered with Air France, as I will now avoid booking with either airline in the future. I refuse to pay for business class tickets when the service is better in economy.\\n\\nPerhaps when Air France completes its cabin refresh and starts caring about its passengers again, I might reconsider. Until then, I’ll stick with Emirates.]', 'I travelled with my daughter for the summer hols, from Jeddah to Washington via CDG.

We then deplaned with the promise of a free lunch on Air France and were told that the restaurant food services would be informed and we had to do nothing else.  Not so.  We had to wait in line for a voucher.  Some people found this out only after they had eaten their meals and could not be reimbursed.

We were given incorrect instructions as to where to go to find out about rebooking and accommodations.  We and the other exhausted passengers walked about the airport until some kind sole told us where to go.  Air France put us up in a residential building without a restaurant on premises or nearby.  We had to walk nearly a mile in the airport to reach the shuttle to the building.  They gave us a bagged dinner that consisted of a premade sandwich, a juice box and some non-descript pastry.  Welcome to France.  They rebooked us through Dubai (instead of a direct flight) on an African airline two days later, claiming that this was the earliest that we would be able to reach Nairobi.

They also only gave €15 for three meals, which is utterly inadequate. I never expected such poor hospitality from the airline.

Mrs Fatbear is recovering from a hip operation but can get around with the use of a walking stick, so we didn’t envisage any problems getting through Paris CDG.\\n\\nOur flight from London to CDG was pretty decent. We landed at the K gates in terminal 2E and our connecting flight to St Maarten was also departing from a K gate. However, it was a long traipse to the security area, where it was chaotic, but I eventually found someone to advise where the Priority Lane was, as this was not visible from the entrance to the security area, maybe due to the masses of people there.\\n\\nNew security machines had been introduced so that only liquids had to be taken out of our bags, all electronic devices could remain where they were. The journey from disembarking our arriving flight to clearing security took 30 minutes, and already the board was showing that our flight to St Maarten was boarding so we didn’t have time to visit the AF business lounge.\\n\\nThe departure lounge resembled a zoo, and we had a long walk to the gate, which required going down a level, and with the escalator broken, we took a lift. Our aircraft was on a remote stand so a bus was needed to get to it. The bus was crammed packed and gave us a tour of most of the airfield before we were deposited at the second furthest plane from terminal 2E.\\n\\nClimbing the stairs to the aircraft was difficult for Mrs Fatbear, and I had to carry all of our hand luggage.\\n\\nThe A330 has a 2-2-2 configuration in Business Class but didn’t seem to have any more cabin space that the 2-4-2 on BA’s 777s.\\n\\nThe seat had a really annoying over the shoulder seat belt with hardly any length to the buckle and there was a noticeable lack of storage space around the seats. Although it converts to a lie flat bed, the area for your feet is very narrow and goes under the seat in front. The shared armrest between the two aisle seats is also very narrow and not suitable for placing anything on except perhaps an elbow.\\n\\nA standard amenity kit with the usual offerings was provided, and champagne, orange juice or water were given out prior to take-off.\\n\\nLike in London, there was a problem with a passenger no-show so yet again, we took-off 50 minutes behind schedule but were still expected to arrive on time.\\n\\nA very nice-looking menu booklet was handed out and our main meal order was taken shortly after departure. Drinks were served around 30 minutes after take-off with the food starting to arrive just under an hour into the flight. \\n\\nI didn’t want the starters but was given it anyway, and it wasn’t particularly nice. The main chicken and gnocchi course was OK though, and some French mustard was offered to go with it so at least there was a bit of flavour, as it would have been pretty bland without this.\\n\\nMidway through the flight one of the cabin crew asked if we would put down both of our window blinds as some passengers wanedt to get some sleep. Seeing this was a day flight, I am puzzled why airlines insist on this, especially as the amenity kit includes eye shades for those who want to sleep. I’m not sure why they bother to include them. \\n\\nAs I wanted to read we kept one of the blinds open rather than put a light on. When I went to the toilet soon after, I noticed about two thirds of the cabin were awake watching the inflight entertainment rather than sleeping. \\n\\nThe toilet, situated between rows 4 and 5 was the largest I have ever come across on an aircraft. Even the very large people in the US show 600 Pounders would not have any problems using the facility ! \\n\\nWiFi was available but it wasn’t free, costing €10 for one hour or €22 for the whole flight. I didn’t bother with it.\\n\\nJust over an hour before landing more food was served. The main item was a brioche cut in half with a filler which was mostly goat’s cheese. Again, it wasn’t great. I didn’t eat the grapefruit salad, but Mrs Fatbear said it was the only nice thing she had eaten on both our flights. There was also a finger shaped piece of sponge cake which was pretty tasteless.\\n\\nOur arrival at St Maarten was on time despite the late departure. Juliana Airport was ravaged by hurricane Irma in 2017 and still hasn’t been fully renovated. However, the four parking fingers to the terminal are again operational and three aircraft were already attached to the terminal as we taxied. Unfortunately, the A330 parked at the gate but wasn’t connected to the terminal. Instead, we had to go down some steps before boarding another packed bus, which took what seemed to be 10 minutes to travel the 400 metres to the arrivals area.\\n\\nFinding some positives, the AF flight attendants were very friendly but surprisingly the food was terrible. Next time we will go back to BA via Antigua.]', \"During the on-line check-in I had to scan our passports to be uploaded to our reservation. It worked first time for Mrs Fatbear’s passport but took five attempts for mine before it was successful. This turned out to be a waste of time as we had to show our passports at the gate anyway.\\n\\nThe boarding pass recommended arriving at T4 at 03.45 for a 06.15 departure. Nothing was open when we arrived at T4 at 04.15 except some check-in desks. Security did not open until 04.30 but not the fast-track, so this was one privilege of business class not available. \\n\\nThe last time I flew Air France from T4, admittedly pre-Covid, Sky Team had a lounge but this has now been taken over by Etihad. None of the information screens in the departure lounge made reference to Air France/KLM having access at any of the lounges in T4, although I have subsequently learnt that the Plaza Premium Lounge is available for AF business passengers, although it is completely at the opposite end of the terminal from where AF flights depart !\\n\\nBoarding started on time at 05.45 but once on board it was announced that one passenger had been denied boarding, and their five bags needed to be off-loaded. Mrs Fatbear watched the comedy events outside from her window seat, as it took 50 minutes to locate the bags before we could proceed with the departure. I thought airlines now had baggage processes automated so they knew where everyone’s luggage was located in the hold, but apparently this must not be the case.\\n\\nOur aircraft was an Airbus 220 and had a 2-3 configuration, with the middle seat of the three blocked in business class. The leg-room was reasonable and better than I remember in BA's Club Europe.\\n\\nWe eventually took-off over 50 minutes late but with the flight only taking 35 minutes we were on the stand at CDG only 20 minutes behind schedule.\\n\\nThe breakfast served was nicely presented but the pancake with a cheese filling with sliced gherkins and carrots, but it tasted very bland although it was edible. The croissant was fresh, but I didn’t try the pineapple salad. Champagne was available but it was too early in the morning, even for Mrs Fatbear, so we had just an orange juice ! On such a short flight, we were served just 10 minutes after take-off.]\", \"Besides departing behind schedule on my first flight to Paris.

We spoke with an AF lady at the  gate and a flight attendant about our connection at 1:20 pm Paris time. We rushed through security to the gate on arrival but missed our flight. We were told at the service desk (after queuing for an hour in very hot conditions) we could travel that evening 9 pm via Incheon with Korean Air. Not only unacceptable but I felt unwell with a heart rate of 135 bpm on my smart watch (I have a pacemaker) and made it clear that it was impossible for me to travel that evening.

Air France's business class (at least on the 777 and 787) is definitely a step down from the others.  The food and cabin service is above average, but the seat is poorly laid out and furnished.  The seat controls are on a ledge where my arm rested, which caused unexpected seat movement.  The foot room is cramped.  Using the coat hook blocks part of the video screen. In-flight entertainment is generally poorer on foreign airlines, but Air France offers less selection than BA or Lufthansa.\\n\\nOn the way back my seat malfunctioned and would not recline fully.  I consider this a major problem as lie-flat seats are my primary attraction to business class.  The cabin crew worked on the seat for 20 minutes but ended up shrugging their shoulders.  They said the seat was safe, but it kept sliding back and forth.\\n\\nAs compensation, they offered me flight miles or a $200 voucher.  Since the difference between business and premium economy is well over $1,000, I thought a crappy voucher was ridiculous.

We selected Air France specifically for a layover in CDG—where we had prior arrangements—on our return journey from Istanbul to Los Angeles. However, less than 12 hours before departure, Air France abruptly cancelled our flight without offering any explanation. Despite our attempts to get clarity from their customer service over the phone, we were directed to go to the airport—an hour away—to find out more details. This unexpected situation left us scrambling to make new travel arrangements in Istanbul and completely disrupted our plans back home in the US.\\n\\nAbout half an hour later, Air France informed us via email that our flight had been rebooked with LOT Airlines via Warsaw, Poland, resulting in an arrival time 4 hours later than our original schedule. Additionally, our flight from Warsaw to Los Angeles experienced an additional 3-hour delay, bringing the total delay to 7 hours.\\n\\nWhen we sought compensation under EU 261 regulations, Air France shockingly denied responsibility, claiming our flights were outside the EU. This was perplexing because our original itinerary involved travel to and from CDG, France (within the EU), and we were rerouted through Warsaw, Poland (also within the EU), where we endured a 10-hour layover with significant delays. This ordeal resulted in our arrival time in the US being pushed from 4:05 PM to 11:05 PM, causing immense emotional stress and financial losses due to last-minute constant changes, disruption to work and plans, and navigating foreign countries with limited resources.\\n\\nWe strongly advise against choosing Air France if you value peace of mind.

I had brought with me a portable litter box, so that I could take my 3 cats one by one to the bathroom so they could relieve themselves and not have to go in their carriers. However, when I got up to take the first one (in its carrier) to the bathroom, a flight attendant stopped me and insisted they had to all stay under the seats in their carriers the entire duration of the flight. This was absurd. They were safely in their carriers, and me letting them out in the bathrooms would have caused no harm to anyone!!!! Instead, I was forced to suffer right along with them for the duration of that long flight. It was awful!

A far worse situation for all of us and for the people around us!!!\\n\\nOnce we went through security and arrived at the gate for our connecting flight in Paris, we were so relieved to see that the plane was still there. But then, shockingly, the woman at the gate told me they had \"just this moment closed it.\" However, one of our party was a flight attendant, and she knew the rules as to when the plane doors could be closed, and we were still within the time frame by a few minutes. However, the attendant at the gate apologized and said she had been specifically instructed not to let anyone on the plane who was from the LAX flight, which was totally insane. We begged and pleaded, as we stood there, a party of 5 people with 3 cats who had already endured the long flight from LA and the stress of having to go through security although we were only transitioning. That plane stood there too, at least another 10 minutes, with our empty seats. The entire situation was insane: the airline had very deliberately slammed the door in our faces.\\n\\nWhen, in tears, with my 3 poor cats, we went to the desk to inquire about next flights, we were told the next direct flight to Split was 4 days away. That made the refusal to admit us to this flight all the more insane, of course. We then were forced to change terminals yet again, go through security yet again (also more suffering for my cats, who are 14 years old and had already gone through security twice, once in LA and once in Paris). Once we arrived at the desk for Croatia Airlines, I was forced to pay again for my cats and for the extra luggage, although that had all been paid in LA already. We then had to suffer through the subsequent 2 flights, before finally arriving in Split at 11 pm, 20 hours after we had left LA. We had originally chartered a water taxi to take us to the island of Hvar, our ultimate destination, but of course by midnight, it had long been canceled.\\n\\nNot only all that, but when we arrived, 2 pieces of our luggage did not arrive with us. By the time we finished filling out the forms to report the missing luggage, it was midnight and they locked the airport doors behind us as we left, the last ones to leave the airport. We then had to find a pet-friendly hotel nearby and take taxis to that hotel, incurring additional expenses we never would have had, had we been allowed on that plane in Paris which sat there on the tarmac for 10 minutes as we begged and cried to be let on.\\n\\nWhen I reported this horrible situation to Air France and demanded reimbursement for the over $1000 I had been forced to pay (again!!) for my cats and luggage, plus for the hotel we were forced to stay at, I received this response:\\n\\n\"Thank you for your email dated 3 May 2024 regarding your recent experience while travelling with us.\\n\\nI appreciate that you shared your disappointment with us.

For my departure my luggage was not not loaded on my flight so I went to my home empty handed and waited three days for my luggage. If that was only thing that happened to me on this trip I could have ignored it. BUT in my arrival flights, my route was Delhi to Mumbai to Paris to Vancouver. My Delhi to Mumbai flight was delayed due to incoming flight that was delayed and we reached mumbai one hour late to scheduled time which was fine as we landed at 1:25 and my next flight was at 2:10. I could have taken the flight But your staff stopped us in the middle and told us that we missed the flight even though the flight had not taken off yet. It was later that I got to know that my Mumbai to Paris flight was overbooked. That the staff deliberately stopped us from taking the flight even though we had our boarding passes. Next I had to wait for two full days to my new flight that was allocated to me and for that flight I had to go back to Delhi. WHAT was the point in me coming to Mumbai if I had to go back to Delhi again!!! I had booked my trip 4months earlier so that I can be rest assured that everything will go well. But I did not even get any email that my flight was overbooked and that will be given a new flight ticket.

Months ago we purchased two nonstop tickets from Chicago to Paris. The night before our flight, we got an email that we've been rebooked Chicago&gt;Detroit&gt;Paris, with the first leg being on Delta, the second leg being Air France in Detroit. We were annoyed because we paid for a nonstop ticket, but figured, at least we will still get in Paris, just a few hours after our original itinerary. Well, Delta to Detroit was delayed, and even with 20 of us that got rebooked on that Delta flight in Chicago trying to make the Paris connection, Air France did not wait for us in Detroit. We landed 36 minutes after the scheduled Paris departure. Now, we were stuck for a whole day in Detroit. We had horrible room accommodations, a shuttle that never showed up, and a day wasted on our short itinerary. To make matters worse, there was no one at Detroit airport from Air France (AF) to talk to all day so we tried working through an agent with Delta, but they could not see AF's international flights to help. Since we were now arriving in Paris a whole day later, we had a hotel night we had to pay for, museum tickets purchased in advance we could not use, and dinner reservations with a strict cancellation policy that charged us for not showing, despite our emails and pleas to not charge. Regardless, AF initial decision to bump 20 of us off the original nonstop flight in Chicago to Paris, caused us all to miss a whole day in Paris and cost us hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I made a claim on Air France's website, which they replied to and said because the delay was less than 3 hours, no compensation would be rewarded. What are they even talking about? They clearly did not read our claim, so I called customer service, to which they could only reopen the claim but we cannot talk to anyone on the phone who handles the claims. I pleaded with them on two separate phone calls over two days to please let me talk to someone in claims or customer service or anyone who can help, to which they were very strict in saying there is no one for me to call, I just need to wait another week to hear back by email.

I hope it will help change the mentality. If needed, I am pasting here some paragraphs that can help you write your complaint:\\n\"It is important to highlight that such exorbitant fees for traveling with pets contribute to the abandonment of animals, as many pet owners might not afford these additional costs. According to Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), animals are sentient beings, and the welfare requirements of animals should be respected. Charging such high fees and providing inadequate service does not align with this principle and discourages responsible pet ownership.\\nI kindly request that you review this matter and consider adjusting your pet travel policies to be more reasonable and accommodating. Additionally, I urge you to improve your customer service processes to prevent such frustrating experiences in the future. Lowering these fees and enhancing service quality would not only support animal welfare but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.\"\\nI know it takes time for you guys, but I think the more we do it, the more these companies will understand the urgency of changing their policies on animal welfare.\\nSo... thank you all !]', 'First, when we tried to get our boarding passes online, we probably spent at least 2 hours.

Also, there was mixed messaging as to whether we should get the KLM app or not, and I even heard people at the airport asking if they needed to find KLM or if it was an Air France flight.

Other flights were landing though!  He took up to Amsterdam Schiphol and landed there, he made a long announcement in French, nothing in English and we were told to get off quickly and someone would assist us in AMS terminal.   There was no one there!  A whole plane load with elderly and young, just abandoned.  I walked to a different gate and found a bemused KLM staff who tried to help, but all they could do was to say ‘look for an email from Air France’.  It was 6 hours we waited without any support, until an email came to say our flight from London to Paris had been rescheduled til next morning!  Erm, we were in Amsterdam terminal!   An hour later we got a mail telling us to ignore last mail and wait further details.  Around 9 pm we got a mail saying we would travel to Paris next morning at 10am - laughable!  \\n\\nSpent night in a pod in AMS, still no support from Air France, no one to speak to!  So I went to get the 10am flight next day and as I got to the gate, the next message stated it was delayed until 1pm!  This meant I would miss my second day flight to Mexico, so I had to abandon the trip and got KLM to return me to London.  \\n\\nIt didn’t end there!  My bag had to be tracked and was later delivered home (good service from the London baggage firm).  I wanted to speak to an Air France rep about compensation and costs.  There was no one in Heathrow, except I found a couple of women at a checkin desk who just shrugged their shoulders and told me to fill in a claim online!   \\n\\nI applied for a refund of my fare through. Virgin Atlantic (who booked the trip).  I got the airfare refunded after 5 weeks with no chance to contact anybody and was told to claim costs and complete from Air France.  Again another form online, no one to speak to!  I was informed by email the flight was cancelled due to weather (not that the pilot was a coward), and no compensation was due, despite twice being informed of long delays and spending 24 hours in Schiphol airport!  They owe me accommodation, costs for cancelled accommodation in Mexico, lost business and for the food and drinks I had to buy at the airport.  \\n\\nThey abandoned a whole flight, were uncontactable, ignorant and incompetent.

Our plane to Paris ran into a long stretch of turbulence, so they had to serve the meal late. Unfortunately, the flight was marred by further turbulence later on, so it was somewhat stressful.\\n\\nBy contrast, the flight home from Paris in an A330 was uneventful.

When I was making flight reservations on December 27, 2023 to fly to Paris on September 16, 2024, I discovered Air France Premiere Class and realized Air France had a flight AF 0025 from Los Angeles to Paris on which this class was available.  So I booked flights from Honolulu Hawaii to Paris through the Air France website and paid for Premiere Class to Paris and Business Class on the return;  Premiere Class cost about $6000.00 US more.\\n\\nOn April 19, 2024, I just happened to check our reservations and found that Air France had changed them from Premiere Class to Business Class without notifying me and/or crediting the difference in air fare to my credit card.  So, I called Air France customer service line and tried to alter our reservations to connect with their flight AF 0023 that also went from Los Angeles to Paris, but was told I wasn’t allowed to do that because those Premiere Class seats were for new reservations, not for changes (in spite of the fact that I had paid for the seats four months prior).  I decided that this person had to be a “weekend” person and that I would check again on Monday, April 22, 2024.  In the mean time, the Premiere Class seats were taken by other people.\\n\\nOn Monday, April 22nd, I called again and the gentleman I spoke with did try to find Premiere Class seats, but was unable to find anything that would get us into Paris on September 17 (we have a tour starting) so we changed our flights from the Island of Kauai to Paris through Los Angeles in Business Class, but I am still due my refund of the difference between Premiere Class and Business Class which is about $6000.00.  \\n\\nI called Air France customer service again on May 17, 2024 to at least get a contact phone number for some one who could give me my $6000.00 back.  The young woman I spoke to told that I would not be able to get my money back until I take the flight in September because that is their policy - no other reason.  I asked for some one else I could contact and she gave me an email address to which I sent an email on May 19, 2024 explaining the situation and asked, for the fourth time, for my fare difference back immediately.\\n\\nThe following morning I got a reply by email from Lorenzo, to go back to the customer service phone number that had told me to contact his department.  Basically, giving me the run around.

For lunch we started with an appetizer of a tiny maybe 2” square plate of cream cheese, hazelnut and pine nut crumble. It was disgusting. Would have preferred nuts. The Shrimp Starter was bland. I selected the Crab and Shrimp Ravioles with Breton curry sauce. The “raviole” was one big ravioli (odd) vs the little square ones I’m used to, and it did not have a heavy seafood taste. The only thing that saved the dish was the wonderful curry sauce. Prior to arrival we had Chicken fillet with tomato sauce, a dish that was fairly dry.

I also understand the reason airlines prefer less bags and charge for additional weight/pieces. As I booked my parents standby to and from India, we didn't know in advance what airline they would be returning with(along with baggage restrictions) based on loads, until shortly before their return. The issue in this circumstance is that they were charged a total of $980 Canadian for 2 legs which we believe is an unreasonable amount. It appears that Air France has decided to just charge whatever they want to maximize profit with little regard for customer service and a positive experience for guests, especially ones travelling interline.\\nHere is the experience from my parents point of view:\\nOur trip with Air France started in Delhi, India where we were booked to fly to Paris and then to Vancouver on 29th Feb, 2024\\nAlthough the Staff at Indian Airport was very friendly, they did charge for extra suitcases for me and my wife, from Delhi to Vancouver at $120 CAD each.\\nWe each had a cabin briefcase and a personal item with us which was allowed without any issue.\\nInterestingly my itinerary mentioned the flight departure at 1:45 AM as well as the online check-in, but the boarding pass indicated the time as 5:15 AM.\\nI confirmed the flight time by calling Air France office in Delhi and confirmed the time as 5:15 AM which means that my connecting flight from Paris to Vancouver was no longer an option for me.

We tried to explain that we are interline standby travelers and we are already connecting through an Air France flight where it was not an issue, but the person there was not ready to listen to us nor was he talking to us in English. He just kept pushing us to go and book our cabin bags.\\nWe had to go back and book our cabin briefcases and they charged us an excessive amount for that (240 Euro for each of the 2 cabin briefcases)  \\nWe wanted to talk to someone and raise our concerns but no one was ready to talk to us or listen to us , probably because we were English speaking.\\n\\nAs someone in the industry, I believe it would be hard to justify this amount.

This is after spending our entire two week vacation buying clothes, shoes, doing laundry, and spending hours calling AF every day to get a status update. \\n\\nWe submitted the claim online as we were instructed to in order to be reimbursed for all the expenses.  The claim was quickly denied because they say it was made more than the 21 allowed time frame from when the bag was delivered.  Very conveniently for them they only looked at the first bag.  We then respond with the information about the 2nd bag, submit all the documentation (which had already been provided).  This is where they ghost you.  Once the claim is closed that is it.  Nothing you do will get you to anyone that can help you.  The phone number which has an option for “check the status of your claim”, one would think that would take you to the claims department, it does not, it takes you to reservations, and they cannot do anything about the claim except for “put a note” on it and there are no supervisors.

The flight attendant would ONLY address that passenger as \"Madame\" which she never addressed me. The flight attendant would ONLY tell the white lady \"Merci.\" When I told the flight attendant \"Thank you\" she said NOTHING TO ME. This is discriminatory behavior and should be addressed.\\n\\nI have never been on a flight ever where they skipped the aisle person and asked the middle person FIRST. It\\'s because the woman sitting in the middle seat was white and the flight attendant thought she was more important than I.\\n\\nI am sitting in the aisle seat and making eye contact with the flight attendant, AND SHE BLANTANTLY IGNORED ME AND ONLY SERVED THE WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE SEAT BEFORE ME FIRST, THEN ASKED ME SECOND THAT IS DISCIMINATION EVERY SINGLE time they gave out drinks, breakfast and lunch.\\n\\nShe treated me like a second class citizen as if I were \"less than\" which is probably why she only asked the white lady what drink she wanted or food she wanted first even though she was in the middle seat.

Our family flies internationally multiple times per year and we have never had an experience like this. First, we booked extra leg room seats and paid extra for them($400) 6 months in advance. About a month before the trip, they moved our seats and separated me and my husband in the back of the plane(with no refund, mind you) due to “operational reasons”. We logged in to see all the seats are clearly open so their “operational reasons” were a lie. We moved them again and paid again to have the same seats. They then move us the day of check-in due to “operational reasons” and this time at least refund us(only for the second time, we have still not received a refund for the first time). We were not surprised to see someone else seated in our seats we paid for when we got on the plane (supposedly they give them to whoever they prefer). On top of that, they made us check in our carry on because they have the worst space for carry on luggage I have ever seen on any plane. The one they did allow us to carry on, we had to put many rows behind us due to having no space anywhere near our seats. We made it there to Naples to find out that our luggage did not make the flight and will be coming sometime the next day. \\n\\nThe luggage may be Air France’s issue or our previous airline’s issue so I’ll let that one slide. We got our luggage about 4 days into our trip. \\n\\nThe biggest issue was on the way back.

They had also touched our ticket and thus our other airlines could no longer check us in for the other flights on our itinerary or even move other flights on our itinerary. This left us with a 6 hour layover that we could not change through Delta. We ended up not being able to sleep at all because we did not discover this change until midnight due to no notifications and had to immediately pack and leave our hotel.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at our boarding gate, I was then pulled(on no sleep already!) aside for a second security check 20 minutes before take-off because they booked our tickets last minute and made us look suspicious since it was no longer a two way international ticket!!!\\n\\nPlease, if you have any regard for your travel, do not book Air France.

However, upon arriving at Mumbai airport, I was blindsided by the revelation that I couldn't proceed to São Paulo through Paris due to a transit visa requirement. The shock and confusion were overwhelming. Here's where Air France fell short:\\n\\n1. Misleading Information: Nowhere during the ticket booking process did Air France mention the need for a transit visa. As a result, I found myself stranded at the airport, unable to continue my journey.\\n\\n2. Stress and Racism:\\n The lack of clear communication caused immense stress. Moreover, I felt discriminated against, as if my nationality played a role in their decision. No passenger should endure such treatment.\\n\\nDenied Boarding and Financial Loss\\n\\n1. Denied Boarding: Air France left me with no choice but to cancel my ticket. Imagine the frustration of being at the airport, ready to fly, only to be turned away due to an oversight by the airline.\\n\\n2. Inadequate Refund:\\n To add insult to injury, the refund process was a nightmare. Out of the ₹ 75360 I paid, I received a paltry ₹ 4369 back. This discrepancy is entirely unjust and unacceptable.\\n\\nPassenger Rights and EU 261\\n\\n1. EU 261: \\nAs an EU-based airline, Air France is subject to EU 261 regulations. These rules protect passengers' rights in cases of flight disruptions, including denied boarding due to visa issues.\\n\\n2. Compensation:\\n I urge Air France to honor its obligations under EU 261. Compensation should not be a mere formality; it's a matter of fairness and respect for passengers.\\n\\nWhat Air France Can Do\\n\\n1. Transparency: Air France must improve transparency during the booking process. Clearly communicate visa requirements to passengers, ensuring they make informed decisions.\\n\\n2. Fair Compensation: \\nRefund policies should be fair and consistent. Passengers deserve more than a fraction of their hard-earned money back.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nMy experience with Air France was disheartening.

But the worst part was learning that the flight would use a bus gate at K52 to take passengers to a plane parked at another terminal.  Jammed into busses, both business and economy passengers  endured a 15 minute ride to the plane only to have to walk up three flights of stairs with their carry-on baggage.  After a long wait on an overcrowded jetway to the plane, exhausted sweaty customers were greeted by sympathetic flight crew who promised that the flight itself would be better which it was.  \\nIt’s truly sad to that an otherwise good flight would be marred by such ground experiences which seem to be ongoing.

So, I booked the flight. Then they canceled the pet request because the layover was not long enough. So, the agent books a different flight, and they cancelled that one because the plane on one leg of the flight did not allow more than one pet in hold. After literally 20 phone calls, and 20 hours of my time attempting to book a flight with my pets, it occurred to me that there are zero flights from Chicago to Turin that will accomodate them. I asked if there were any flights to any nearby airports, and the agents were unable to find even one. I asked for a refund, due to my being given false information regarding travel with pets on this route, they refused, because the 1k flight was non-refundable. I ended up asking which type plane allows more than one pet, and I was able to research and find a flight myself, going into Bologna..... a 5-6 hour drive from where I needed to be. Also keep in mind, when traveling with pets, you must remove your them from the carrier goong through security, or put them through an x-ray machine designed for non-living items. However in Paris, unlike other airports, they do not have a room to remove your pets in, so if your cat doesn't appreciate going back in the carrier, good luck. Luckily my cat ultimately was more afraid of the airport, than he was the carrier, so I only had a few scratches. Then, upon attempting to board the second leg of the flight in Paris, they weighed my carry on PLUS my purse together, and was told it was 1kg to heavy, and I needed to check the carry-on bag.  Except the bag contained a 3k camera and 2k worth of medication, and all my pet supplies, none of which I could ditch. I asked them to document the expensive contents and was told the medicine and pet supplies would be okay, but it would be best not to check the camera. So clearly they are aware their own employees are thieves, and they still work there? Finally a manager came out and made an exception for me to carry it in cabin. However, this process took so long, I missed the connecting flight. So, they had to remove my 60 pound dog and my cat, that were already checked into cargo, and I had to wait in the airport with all 3 of them for an additional 4 hours until the next flight. Of course, they tried to charge me a flight change fee, but as my voice got louder, they decided to do me a huge favor and waive that. Now, I land in Bologna at 23:30, and the rental car was closed, so not only did I pay a day for a rental car that I didn't have, I had to take a $100 cab to a $200 hotel room, then another $100 cab back to the airport in the morning to rent a car, for my 5 hour drive to Turin with 3 animals. On top of this, one of my checked bags didn't make it to Bologna. I suppose I should be grateful they even found it. I received an email on 5 March, stating my bag arrived at Bologna airport. I made arrangments for it to be delivered on 10 March, because although my daughter lives in Bologna and could pick it up, we would still have to get it to Torino. After waiting all day, the bag did not arrive. So, I called Air France to see why it wasn't delivered, and was told my bag was enroute to Bologna from Paris? Then the next day, they told me it did actually arrive on the 5th, so I asked them again to deliver it. They told me they handed it to ONX courier, who will contact me. It us now 14 March, and no word from the courier. I had asked for the courier phone number, and they gave me 2 numbers, one of which is out of service, and one they don't answer. AF refuses to give me an email so that I can contact the company myself, but assured me they would email them, but today they told me the company never responded to the email. So, today 14 March, I called AF and asked that they get my bag back from the courier, and I will take a day to go to Bologna to retrieve it there. Of course, they again emailed the company that clearly has zero employees to answer it. It won't long before it can be deemed lost. Been there, and anyone who has been there can tell you this will entail hours locating receipts and making spreadsheets, only to be told the value of your items are 1/10 of what it would cost to replace them, and if you don't have receipts, you are out of luck (because you know everyone just wants to rip off these honest, ethical airlines when THEY lose YOUR luggage). Bottom line, I am sure this is a perfectly fine Airline to fly international, as long as you do not have pets or checked baggage, as their agents are ill-informed regarding pets, and even if they find your bag after they lost it, they will hand it to a courier that doesn't deliver your bag, answer their phone, or respond emails. After this total nightmare, where my poor cats were traumatized after being crated for 24 hours in urine soaked carriers (I uploaded a photo of one of them, around hour 20), I realize I would have literally saved 50 hours of time, and 1k, had I simply re-booked with a different airline,  cancelling the Air France flight all together, with no refund.]\", \"The flight was late leaving EDI.
