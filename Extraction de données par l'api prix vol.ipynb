Like we were true jet setters from a bygone era.    Once onboard of AF027 Airbus A 350-900 found our seats 7 and 8 k with not one but two windows each.  The seat is configured at a slight angle so you are always looking outward.  These seats fully recline and are comfy even without needing a comforter used by many other airlines. Plenty of room to stretch out. The seat angle and privacy door help make the space truly your own.

The seating compartment is well designed for  work, sitting back and chilling, or sleeping the flight away. While offer the standard amenity kit, slippers, and blanket, each are of a high quality.   The food options and quality is some of the finest dining you will have in the air . It can give many a restaurant on the ground a run for their money.

It was food so good you want to eat slowly and savor every bite.   Then there\\u2019s the Champagne which was offered as both a welcome aboard drink, and throughout the flight. Also a commendable wine list.  One would expect nothing less of the flagship carrier of France.  Prefer non-alcoholic options?, of course still and bubbly water, soft drinks, coffees and teas are available.   The inflight entertainment provides a variety of options from around globe in multiple languages. The lineup of movies, shows, documentaries, and games means you will never get board even after 8 hours in the air. Watching our night landing at LAX through the tail and fuselage cameras were a sight to behold.   The system visual and audio quality were superb. The touchscreen and handheld remote very responsive. The headphones were of high quality and comfortable to wear.  The cherry on top was the amazing service. Polished, professional. Attentive but not intrusive. No request to large, no question unanswered. Their confidence and presence make you feel safe and cared for.   Air France set a new bar for us. The value is there.  Even in business class on most long haul flights you leave exhausted and counting the minutes of the last couple of hours in the air. We did not want our Air France flight to end.

No request to large, no question unanswered. Their confidence and presence make you feel safe and cared for.   Air France set a new bar for us. The value is there.

The seat is configured at a slight angle so you are always looking outward.  These seats fully recline and are comfy even without needing a comforter used by many other airlines.

The headphones were of high quality and comfortable to wear.  The cherry on top was the amazing service. Polished, professional. Attentive but not intrusive. No request to large, no question unanswered. Their confidence and presence make you feel safe and cared for.   Air France set a new bar for us. The value is there.

No request to large, no question unanswered. Their confidence and presence make you feel safe and cared for.   Air France set a new bar for us. The value is there.
